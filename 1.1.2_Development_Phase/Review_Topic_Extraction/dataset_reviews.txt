{I just had my very first experience in transferring a car from the bank into my personal name on Saturday, 17 August 2024 (Plumstead office). What an absolute pleasure! The process was seamless and quick. After being assisted with a ticket, a very short wait ensued till I was called to counter 4. Handed in my forms to Lethu who was on hand to assist, and 5 minutes later I was given the registration certificate confirming that the vehicle is MINE! The friendly efficiency of this staff member put me at ease, and made me less anxious, and the service received was exemplary. Thank you Lethu and CoCT!}{I renewed my car Licence online with COCT and eft paid on 27 July. I queried the non arrival of the disk on 16th August and received a timeous reply that it had been posted to me on 1st August.
Like my municipal bills arriving very late, surely COCT must realise that their system only ends when the goods are received by the customer. 
If the SAPO can’t deliver efficiently, surely something must change at COCT?}{I have been without electricity since 11oclock on Sunday and have logged 2 and 3 calls a day. It is now Wed 14th Aug 24 and I have had every excuse in the book, escalations and promises of calls and to date nor a single one from this *********** City of Cape Town Electricity Dept.}{It's been a really horrible year dealing with COCT...

At the end of Jan 2024 I received a very high water bill which covered 2 months of actual water usage. 

Unfortunately for me in those 2 months I had experienced 2 separate water leaks on my property, one major one which was on the COCT's side of the meter, with water constantly overflowing from the street drains for 2 weeks and us experiencing regular bubbling noises from our toilets with air in the taps. The other one was on our side and a smaller leak, identified and fixed only 4 days after the actual water reading at the start of the billing cycle.

What I have since learnt is that although it is public knowledge that these water meters spin up unfairly when air passes through them and provide inaccurate readings, COCT refuses to acknowledge that this is even possible and it was like talking to a brick wall, so after unsuccessfully talking to the wall for weeks the only other reasonable option I had left was to assume the excessive water usage was from the smaller leak on my side and pursue a water rebate.

I did pursue a water rebate, it was compiled and sent for approval but then absolutely nothing. It's been 3 months since it was sent for approval, no feedback.

Additionally, the water leak on the COCT's side of the water meter resulted in the COCT having to lift the paving in front of my house again. This has never been put back, 8 months after it was lifted. I logged a reinstatement request with COCT, only for it to be closed immediately, I queried why it was closed and was told that's normal, it's now with a different department. That was many months ago.

On the utility bill they make it clear that any billing issues are YOUR problem, you MUST pay whatever they come up with regardless of if it is in error, any errors on their side will be dealt with and they will reimburse you later. It's a convenient system for them when you consider that they don't put any effort into dealing with such things.}{The "****TY OF CAPE TOWN" is really giving a ****ty service delivery. I am really ****ed at COCT for not delivering a service. Have logged a blocked sewer on Monday 5 August 2024 and still waiting on ****ty of Cape Town to come out. This is really poor service delivery from COCT. No really man COCT do what you get paid to do and not just wait for pay day}{Logged a drainage problem at home on Saturday.

After numerous calls and hundreds of rands in airtime wasted 
I am no further in solving the mystery of getting the drain

Just got another message to some kind of follow action has being activated.
What does that mean since I have being getting this message since Monday.
Does it mean f.. you, wait bstrd. That is how I feel.

I have even tried my local Counceller Roger Cannon. This guy does not 
answer WhatsApp or phone calls. So what was the point of voting for this. 
Same people same bad service. Cozy government job at the tax payer expense. Nice man !!

Myself and Fiancè decided to start/invest in a small pop up business (stall set up) - we would like to sell hot foods such as Boerewors Rolls, Hot Chips, Burgers, Beverages (Cooldrinks/Water) at Welmoed Cemetery in Eersteriver.

Yesterday I was at Kuilsriver Municipality Environmental Health Office, the Clerk gave me Samantha October's number to ask for availability. Samantha told me Welmoed does not fall under her area and that i need to contact Liam Jane, he is based at Bellville Municipality.
I contacted Liam about 5 times with no success, i went to Bellville Municipality office whereby they directed me to Stikland Municipality and said Welmoed fall under there area (i did say that Welmoed is further from Stikland as from Bellville which i was told Welmoed falls under them).
So I went to Stikland Environmental offices where I was dreadfully referred to  Durbanville Environmental offices, they gave me the contact number of Danielle who is the Environmental Health Practitioner which I contacted but no answer and had to drive to there offices.

When I arrived at Durbanville Municipality, I was referred to contact you as Welmoed falls under your area for inspections. I have contacted you a few times on numbers received at Durbanville **********  but weren't successful.
I really don't know what else to do to get to the correct person for a Hawkers license.

To avoid further unnecessary run-arounds - would you please be so kind as to confirm if you are the Environmental Health Practitioner for Welmoed and could you assist us?

We look forward to hearing from you.

On 9 July 2024 at -09h02 I got a call from CoCT water, Parow depot, Jonathan **********.
Asked me if the water was still off.
Told him since yesterday and nobody was out to repair.
He said their plumbing contractor will repair this morning and get the water back on.
He sounded a bit iffy, so I'm very skeptical.

At 09h30 I call the **********, got connected to the water call centre, where a helpful guy assisted me.
He said he did not know where Jonathan got that information.

I work in the CBD and rely on this service to navigate the city center, as public transport is a significant challenge for me.

This winter has been particularly harsh, and I have been forced to travel in difficult conditions, often arriving at work soaked and cold. My job is crucial to my livelihood, and I cannot afford to lose it due to transportation issues.

I am extremely disappointed with the lack of response and assistance from Dial-a-Ride and MyCiti. This service is supposed to make life easier for disabled individuals, yet it has only added to my struggles.

I urgently need this transport to continue working and maintaining my independence. With heavy rains expected, how will I get to work? They don't seem to care, even though doctors have requested urgent assistance. The Cape Town government's neglect of disabled people is disheartening.

Is it not inhumane and ******** to deprive people of running water in their house?}{So this passed Monday morning 29/04/2024 I got pulled over by a traffic officer , he tells me that he pulled me over because of my front number plate that is not displayed, i get out and check, no number plate (probably fell off because of all the potholes and uneven road surfaces i drive through everyday) I explain that i was unaware , he tells me he is just doing his job and he needs to take my licence disc, which i fully respect as he was just doing his job.

He then proceeds by asking me where I live and work , which both answers were in Parow, he then tells me that if i sort the number plate out I can go to Goodwood testing station free of charge and they will put the vehicle back on the system and issue me a free licence disc . Good and well I immediately phone in late for work so that i can have this sorted out asap, fitted a new number plate and off to Goodwood testing station, walk in to the testing station and its very quiet i hear movement in one of the offices and i go there and see a City Official busy making coffee, I greet and proceed to explain my situation to him and he just looks at me blatantly ignoring me and continues making his coffee at the same time a female walks in (also an official) she has a seat and tells me that they have been closed for the passed 2 years and that i should go somewhere else and then she and the other official just start their own conversation as if I was never there.

I get back to work and phone the City helpline and is told to go to Bellville Vehicle Testing Centre.

So now I am in complete shock as how a traffic official does not know that these Testing Stations are closed and neither does the people on the other side of the help line, Does the City of Cape Town Management even know that these Testing Stations are closed because there are people in the offices but no testing of vehicles is being done.

What a load of *******, it's more like "The city that let's it do the work for them"

I had two reference numbers which related to my problem:

2024/03/08 I logged a case ********** and the call centre confirmed it is probably on the city side.
When I closed the stopcork in my property the water meter keeps running, but it stops when the tap on the meter is closed.
This leak must have started during the night of Saturday 2024/04/06 and the meter reading increases rapidly and water comes up from under the ground, so the leak must be bad.

2024/04/08 at around 11am a CoCT contractor came out, 2 guys.
I showed them that when I close the stop tap on my property the water meter keeps running, but it stops when the tap on the meter is closed.
The 1 guy came into my property and put his hand down onto the stopcork in my property and came to the conclusion that the stopcork is the problem.
To me this is unacceptable and no proof of where the leak is.
The stopcork is 52cm below the ground and has a drain pipe around it that presses up against the stopcork.
This pipe over the stopcork was inserted in 2022 by the CoCT when I had a similar leak and it was eventually found on the COCT's side being more than 1 leak.

I eventually got a private plumber out that dug up and found the leak to be on the CoCT side.
The short piece of polycarb pipe connected to the stopcork had cracked and broke.
A CoCT tem showed up about 1.5 hours after the plumber had fixed everything.
My 1 question is, why send guys to check the meter when an underground leak is reportd.
The team that came late should have been the 1st to be sent out.
The CoCT adimtted this is their rsponsibility.
Now they just ignoring me when I want my paving reinstated by them, because the fault was actually something they had to fix.
I've went as far as emailing the mayor and premiere, and my ward councilor is of no use at all.
So who do I turn to now, because the CoCT and DA are just full of empty promises?
Election will definitely take a lot of deep thought.}{What a bad first experience at AMWAY CAPE TOWN!

On the website the office hours indicate the the Amway in Cape Town will be open until 15h00 on 27 April 2024. There was NO indication that the shop will close earlier. The notice that times might be affected by the public holiday, was no where indicated. 

We had to travel 1,5 hours to get to the shop! We TRUSTED the fact that the update on the website indicated the shop closes soon. 

Arriving at Amway Cape Town, me, my husband and two other clients were waiting in front of the door, 14h03. 

Apparently the shop closed at 14h00, without ANY indication, except a small piece of paper on the window, stating the office hours for the day.

All good and well...however, the store manager came out, very unfriendly, saying they are closed. My husband said the we drove 1,5hours! The other client asked if she cannot accommodate us. She said no. Very angry, my husband (unfortunately) cursed at the business and turned around to walk away. 

The store manager shouted after him: Ah, **** you!.

 PLEASE: WHY?

A COMPANY LIME AMWAY? 

We were all taken aback by this.}{Upon them coming out and checking the meter readings which they don't always do, I found out I had a leak on my property which I had fixed immediately. This pushed up my bill which I still continued to pay every month. As a widow with one income times have been tough which I did explain to them on email. On the 25th April they turned off my water supply without my knowledge.  The letter I received which was stuck by my door advised to pay arrears nd email proof for reconnection. After borrowing money to pay R3700 which is alot they refuse to turn my water back on because of a R531.14, how pathetic is it that they apparently work for us but they can do this to us. I am very disappointed in the service they offer, there is many burst pipes where lots of water is running out here in summer greens the water is off alot due to these issues but nothing happens about that loss of water. But they want to charge me additional charges of R500 every month added to my bill even though they know how bad things are. They do not care about the people and it's so sad we live in  a country under these conditions.}{My water and my neighbours water went off on the 9th April 2024, on the 10th of April 2024 the City of Cape Town sent out someone to change the water meter at this point the guy realized that there was no water flow from the mains for both properties, he then advised that he will escalate it to the DEPO,  now mind you no one has till today came out to fix it even after having to call daily, going to the offices, speaking to the ward councillor and escalating it to the mayor's office. It's the 25th of April today and we still don't have water. This is really inhuman as by law you not suppose to go without water for more than 7 days a year. No one is able to give me a proper answer as to why the issue has not been fixed. Really very disappointing and to top it all off I have elderly neighbors}{I am so frustrated at the service and response we have been getting from City of Cape Town Water service departments. 
I have had a leak outside of my property for more than a month now, I have logged many calls, emails, and SMS, and the feedback I get is that the matter is at the Depo and there is nothing they can do but wait.

It been more than 30 days since we logged this, and there is no way to get ahold of anyone other than a customer agent.

Since the last call the ticket has been escalated to the Regional Manager and it's been 3 days since and no call, no person coming out to check anything.


The water and sanitation department should do better, we are always made aware that we should use water wisely, yet they cannot fix a leak that has been running for more than a month.}{Dear Municipal Manager of CCT

Please tell me how it is that cables are vandalised, according to the investigative report which I apparently have to pay R100.00 to see if my request is granted, it becomes the consumer's problem? 

My electricity was off for a couple of days leading to spoilt perishables which I alerted the CCT of in October 2023. I was then advised to submit a claim and it will be reimbursed (according to the customer care consultant). I sent an email in October 2023 and received a mail in January 2024 (3months) whereby I furnished them with the required documents. 

Following a couple of months of no feedback, I reached out them and was informed of the three month turnaround time. Again, no problem with that as it is procedure. Then Mandy Zeeman comes back to me stating that she sees no negligence on the part of the CCT; hence claim rejected. 

The CCT has contingency plans and insurance in place for these damages, I would think. Question is what about the consumer? You are told to contact the treasury department and claim your losses. Upon doing what you are advised, an investigation is conducted that you have no hand in, firstly. Then the claims administrator base the outcomes on what suits the Municipality. 

To top it all, in the event that you should appeal, R300.00 is to be paid first. What utter nonsense is this? Since when do you pay the internal Ombudsman to appeal his process? Why does the consumer have no insight into the investigation? 

When this happened it was said to be a substation issue, now it switched to vandalism! If the vandalism is not your fault, why is it mine? If you cannot be held liable for vandalism, why should the consumer? Why should the consumer have to pay to appeal a process they had no hand in?

Call in this morning, 15APR, spoke to a nice lady Cynthia. She advised, that she could see the sub contractors were here & said leak by stop**** & that it had to be handed over to internal staff. However, instead of it being forwarded onto the correct department. The log was closed. She said she would urgently send it through & make a point of the emergency. She advised a ref for the call would be sent via sms, which i did not receive. Till now, nothing or no one has showed up & water is streaming. Who it going to pay for this excess water!!!! The longer they take, the more we will need to pay for water. Which is not right, when we logged it last Wed already.}{I have had a leak on my property for 2 months. From first logging it on 5 February to now. I have tried all their escalation methods advised, logging, phoning the call centre, including writing to the mayor's email address and the problem has not been attended to.  I have had numerous sms' advising that its escalated to the depot and the Branch Manager but no action.  They actually sent a team out last week that got the brief wrong despite what the logged fault says?   I can't get a water rebate since they first need to fix this, and they reminded me to pay my bill.?}{They one other worse and bad city's, they only do favours for who and who they want to help. We app**** for indigent relief but they come with and that story, telling to fill in forms everytime. They want to know what you eat, how much the food is what you eat etc and all expenses what you do with your own money. There service delivery for coloured people is really worse. There service walk in centres are bad people working there don't know how to talk with you}{We live in a city where Safety and Security is null and void in the less affluent suburbs like Kraaifontein. I live in a fairly upmarket part, yet have regular break-ins, attempted break-ins and theft from my property. Cape Town has one of the world`s highest ****** rates. The Western Cape was reported the unsafest province for women, as reported in Cape Times.

Despite this, J.P. Smith (failed) MEC of Safety and Security puts ALL his resources into the cash-*** of minor traffic violations. He buys expensive cars (why expensive luxury ones???) for the traffic department and equips them with millions of rands worth of technology to find cars with expired licenses or outstanding fines. Yet, moving violations are largely ignored, whereas non-vehicular crime is completely ignored and blamed on National Government. Under JP Smith I feel neither safe or secure, but at least I know parking tickets are a priority!

It is time the MEC is replaced with someone who is effective with all forms of safety and security, and not someone who chases easy money and has the arrogance to take people's hard-earned and VERY NECESSARY cars from them, especially in a city with very limited public transport.

Like my mom used to say: "bo blink, onder stink", which sums up how CT is run.}{I logged a fault with City of Cape Town Water and Sanitation at 6pm on Thursday 28 March 2024.  Water was flowing our of our pavement water meter as well as from somewhere else under the gravel on our pavement.  The WhatsApp chat told me it may take up to 48 hours to resolve the fault.  Seeing the amount of water flowing into the drains and into our property makes me very anxious.  It's thousands of kilolitres going to waste yet the City tells us to reduce our consumption.  I patiently waited throughout Friday, but on Saturday morning I called the fault phone number, and was told it would be attended to today.  At 8:15 today I also WhatsApped a councillor at who escalated this to the depot Manager.   Still no response.  Water still flowing freely.  I am so disappointed in the City Council.  They don't deserve any stars.}{I sent a request for an overflowing sewage drain on 3rd March and up to now nothing happened. They keep on providing with reference for case that gets closed whilst the matte is still outstanding and no one has came thro2to sort it out. If they come through which is twice the whole time, they just have a look and leave without saying a word and they don't come back after. 

The smell is disgusting, the overflowing from the municipality pipe is pouring over to my yard drains, the situation is so dire because our health is at risk. 

For paying rates and get this service is beyond repulsive.}{Poor poor service delivery. I have reported drain blockage from the 16March till today my yard is full of toilet the drain it’s front of my yard I have small kids to live in such state. I have been calling daily without any luck all they say say someone is assigned from the 16th . The city can do better especially election time is coming 

I was given this ref ********** everytime I do
Follow up nothing concrete .

Pls consider my well being and sort this thing out it’s been out of ETA long time.  I can’t even open the front door is this weather coz the the smell is disgusting}{My house has been without electricity since yesterday morning 8am.(no loadshedding scheduled)

What has happened is the City has come to put our main breaker to our house off but in actual fact the was a letter for another house that they were meant to put off. 

We have called over x10 times and been given the same stupid response we will do a follow up and damn reference numbers. 

Bottom line is the incompetence of the City Power Department is ridiculous. 

Quick to put people's electricity off, but not quick to respond to an issue that needs urgent fixing.

1 Galway Road is where the problem needs to be fixed... but STILL WAITING for a team to come fix our problem. 

They were supposed to be sent out again last night before 11pm.

In actual fact there was a team at our house at around 630pm and they could tell us that the Revenue Protection Department had out the wrong house off, the technician then asked a manager can they correct the issue and the manager said no(the Revenue Protection Department) need to come back. 

It's always a ****ING story with the City and a run around to get things done. 

WAKE UP!!!!!}{Our street lights have been off for over a month. I have logged numerous faults on the app and each time I call in or email I get the same response that the matter will get escalated. No explanation on what the fault is or when it will be attended to.}{After several logs submitted to the city of Cape Town. We are now still facing a sewage problem. The city is aware of the issue but yet they fail to assist and do their part. A promise was made from the city side but they are not up keeping to their promise. The worst service ever received from the city. You submit the faults and they take their own time to get back to you.}{City of Cape Town is in breach of the Constitution. You buy a flat. The transferring attorney gets your r City Of Cape Town rates account which you pay every month. SAproperty.com advise you that the levies include water and electricity. Suddenly City of CT get access to the block of flats Mullerhof and put a blue seal on your electricity box as your account is in arrears. No warning although they send a rates and taxes account to an email address. No one trys to contact you to say they have made a mistake and not allocated water and lights to your account which you pay every month. How are you as an individual supposed to locate the missing account or find out who authorised the blue seal????  NO LEGAL PROCESS FOLLOWED. The ANC should take over. I don't think they can do a worse job}{My mother in-law had a fine on her electricity meter box which was cause by city officials by leaving meter box dysfunctional. She went to settle the fine at city of cape town fezeka offices, but when she buys electricity city of cape town still deducts 50%. She has been to the offices to report this several times with no help at all. She is a pensioner and this is costing her a lot of money}{Kindly teach your staff across all departments to. 

1 )Learn how to answer a phone. 
2) Stick to Tea times and lunch times as opposed to (Tea, Second Tea, Lunch, Afternoon tea, after Afternoon tea, Second Lunch and before Knock off tea)
3)How to maintain a conversation and accurately refer a person to the right department. 
4)Not to put the phone down immediately if the line is bad. 

It is ridiculous that I have not been able to get through to the right person for 5 days straight.

Thank you,}{Since October I've been trying to get them repair the street lights in my road, I've phoned them, logged complaints at thier offices to no avail. Then they come on the 4th of March, they remove the light and ***** it back and leave. Light is working for 5 min, then dead. Shows how *********** they are.I wonder will they get payed for incomplete jobs.}{No one is getting back to me I have sent several emails as I bought R700 electricity 1st of Feb and got a dut number}{I’ve been complaining and emailing for the past 3 weeks to the City of Cape Town. Our complex water has been switched off on the 13th of February 2024, and it’s still off!! How can you deny us a basic human need!! What about our constitutional right? What about humanity? We can’t live without water!!!}{City of cape town workers came and made a hole in Madison court, Scottsdene, Kraaifontein because a pipe burst underground on the 23 of February. They left the hole open and since that hole the drains is blocked. Up until today the 5th of march they have not come back to close the hole or unblock the drain after complaint was logged. And in the first place that workers knew about the big hole they made in a place where children is playing. Why must a complaint be logged for them to fix it. They didn't even leave a safety barrier around it}{So let's just get this straight I left home at 6 in the morning knowing that there wasn't going to be loadshedding got it fine not a problem. Right?
Wrong I get home at 10pm and I can't make something to eat nothing and the electricity is still off since around 6 this afternoon according to neighbours in brooklyn so I would like to know where the **** is the people that supposed to fix this **** this is obviously planned or some sort because knowing this government they would do something like this just to **** people off!
You asswholes do realise that if a fridge doesn't have power for a certain amount of hours the motor of the damn thing can also pack up not to mention the food that I left in there wasn't even cold because of how ****ing hot my house is!
Are you guys so useless that you can be regarded as ******s oh no wait wrong term ****** at least know what to do and when to do it you idiots fall under a different bracket completely!
At this point both the city of cape town and eskom can go **** each other because your both ****ing totally ***********!}{March 5, will mark exactly a month since i logged a water leak and the City has done nothing about it! 
I was astonished on day 1 after logging they came out about 7pm to come and look at the fault!
Heres where it gets pretty dismal, they closed my query! I logged a dispute, had to relog it, had to call the call centre weekly to follow up, the action i got was 4 smses to say its logged, registered, in progress and now with the depot for scheduling… a week later still no action! 
But i guess this is standard service? I was promised a rebate but i wonder about that efficient process too😱 I guess i will have to log it?? 
The call centre agents are fabulous though, they really try… but they cant move a system that sucks! Ill keep catching water and hope and pray my rebate happens more efficiently!}{On November 9, 2023, I submitted a request for the removal of two trees with reference number **********. Upon inquiry on February 9, 2024, I was informed by an agent that due to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) not being met, I should wait for three months before following up. Consequently, on February 9, 2024, I called again and was issued a new reference number, **********, marking an escalation since the SLA had been breached. Subsequently, on February 13, I received a call from a lady who indicated that an inspector would assess the trees and determine necessary actions. Despite this assurance, the escalation reference was marked as closed, even though no inspection had occurred. Upon a further inquiry on February 19, I spoke with Vuyo, who explained that he could only add a follow-up note to the initial reference number, as it remained open. Today, February 27, I contacted Zizipho, who mentioned the need for a new escalation, resulting in an additional reference number, as the previous escalation had been closed. I am deeply dismayed by the City's handling of my issue, especially considering the risk to my safety posed by one tree interfering with our electric fence, necessitated by multiple security breaches. Furthermore, the tree serves as a hiding spot for ********s due to its obstructive positioning. The other tree, situated by our driveway, continuously sheds leaves, and its resin has left stubborn marks on our cars. Despite efforts to clean up, the accumulation of leaves persists in our yard and on our vehicles. Additionally, the tree's roots have infiltrated our sewerage pipes, causing repeated overflow issues, prompting numerous calls to the City for assistance. I once again attach pictures of the trees in question and earnestly request the City's prompt attention to this matter, as it has now been four months since the initial request was lodged.}{Good day, 

This water meter was replaced in June 2022, 1year and 8minths later and the damaged water meter cover has not been replaced. 

Numerous service requests done and everytime the request gets closed and nothing done. 

I even obtained the contractor Jason from JSB construction and the excuse is that they dont have stock of the  covers. 

This is really poor service.}{There has been a building construction case that is now ongoing for 3 years. It has landed at the appeal committee in the mayors office. Subsequent to the outcome there has been no action taken.  After numerous emails , calls and even emails to the mayors office nothing has happened to this case. The building inspector all the way to the mayors office cannot get this case to completion. The red tape and inefficiency in the system shows poor governance. I appeal to the mayors office again to gain traction on this matter}{I would like to  convey on behalf of a pensioner her experience with the city of Capetown regarding her pension rebate. (Nov 2023 to Feb 2024).

After submitting her application in November and receiving an automated response further information was submitted in January as was done in years previously.

She was repeatedly told to keep paying her discounted rates amount which she has been doing monthly as the full rates amount was unafordable.After making numerous enquiries to the call centre she was told her application is pending and to keep paying the amount as she has been doing..Any amount owing on the account above what is owing will be written back after the new application is approved she was told.

On the afternoon 13 February her electricity was cut off.
At the age of 95 she is now sitting without any electricity after paying her her monthly account every month

He denide to have my property in his position. Also the vehicle that was left unattended, was broken into and my toolbox with tool got atolen, my Huawei and smsung cellular phones were also taken from the car. What can i do to get my property back and claim any damages?}{Yesterday I reported an emergency to the City of Cape Town. After receiving a reference number very early in the morning. I received responses from their staff on their WhatsApp line and Facebook messenger. And it was not their automated responses it was someone physically responding as their services were available yesterday from 10am till 2pm. They just to completely ignore my fault request after I made it known to them several times it is urgent. After all the fault I am reporting now is due to a previous fault which was never resolved by the city. This lack of competence from the city will result in a high water bill on my side which they clearly will not account for. Is this the type of services we paying for ??? This surely won’t stop here.}{With fustration to express my great disappointnent in COCT's services. Im heading in for week three without water, living under very bad  and unsanitary conditions at home and our kids are suffering the most among us. Our situation has apparently been assigned to a person who supposedly should reconnect our water meter but no one ever comes. I am spending 45 mins per call and wasting 10's of rands worth of airtime to just waste my time. I have sent emails ontop of emails and whatsapp messages to their whatsapp line with no solution. I am being promised day after day the person would come to our property and reconnect the water but no one ever shows up. Its not right at all...nothing about this..we purchased this property 3 months ago and this is what we are dealing with as first time home owners. They apparently had it in the past with the former owner leaving me to only assume they try to avoid him at all cost, not knowing he no longer lives here.

We are living under terrible conditions at home with some of our children sick, ive explained this to their offices.}{Our water has been disconnected on wednesday 24th and is still off. We are living in horrid conditions. We purchased this property in September 2023 and live with no access to our basic water and sanitation needs, as new owners of this property, we havent received any bills or notices from COCT regarding our water...it was disconnected without any notice or anyone informing us that it would be disconnected.}{Today I was at the dept of housing for a title deed for my late mom.

It is smelly and I can't open my doors or windows.It went yesterday to the local Municipal to log  a request for for it be cleaned but no truck has arrived yet. In 2022 we received notification that they would be installing new pipes in our area. That project has still not begun until now. I am currently living in filth Andi really don't think that is fare for me and my family.I also notified my Councilor about this and he told me his waiting on a response from the City. The people living in the shacks built on top of a drain and that is the cause of this blockage. I was told by My councilor that they would have to be removed to another place to stay but that should not make suffer while they are doing that process. I can't even get a car into my driveway because there is dirty water flooded in front of my gate. My gate is also rusted at the bottom because of this water. I can't cut my graas because it's flooded with water. I really don't think this is fair because if this was happening in an area like Constantia this matter would have been solved long time.

As a sectional title owner and also a landlord, my tenants suffered great financial losses and could not keep head above water even long after the pandemic period. They were not the only ones, because I had family members who were also unemployed for long periods due to job losses. The financial pressure on me, as a pensioner, was tremendous which also caused me to fall into arrears with my municipal account.
When I eventually was forced to sell my property in 2023, in order to rid myself of the great financial burden on my shoulders, the City had already taken Legal action against me. They had no consideration for anyone, regardless of the financial suffering that the Pandemic had caused. 
This City is not working for me, but against me and I suppose lots of other ratepayers who had suffered financial losses due to the COVID pandemic. Circumstances alter cases. Shame on this whole local government structure. Heartlessness, towards the ratepayers, is their ultimate goal, regardless of all the suffering that was caused by the global pandemic. 
I'm also not totally surprised by their actions, because the truth is known by all, that the evil that men do will live long after them.}{On 27 Dec. 2023 I logged a request for an invoice for November 2023 which I had not yet received. I got an automated response:

We had an intruder on our premises in August, and this bush is a hiding spot of undesirable individuals attempting to do us and fellow neighbours harm. I emailed the mayors office and was contacted by an individual named Zinzi who assured me she would oversee the process of the field being cleaned.

Unfortunately nothing was done till now. The trees and bush is directly against our vibracrete. After numerous calls, emails nothing has been done. I was advised by the ward counselor to have the field cleaned ourselves, but with quotes exceeding R15000, I do not see why we must pay this huge fees for a area that was supposed to service by City of Cape Town.}{The municipality has decided to switch off water for me and my family.

@HELLOPETER PLEASE ASSIST #######}{After reporting a blocked sewage pipe on the 12-11-23. Reference number ********** I was told that as it was a Sunday it would not count towards 3 day turn around time. I accepted this. To date 16-11-23 it has not been resolved. Countless calls and even the Ward Councilor was ask to intervene. After all the local depot claimed they sent out a truck on 13-11-23. This is a lie. As I have been home all week to sort this out, no truck has been heard or seen in this time. Sewage and faeces spilling out of my drain I could not afford to go to work and come home to find a flooded toilet. There is no way to escalate this and your call center after logging is a brick wall. This is health risk and being summer my entire property stinks to high heaven. Your service and after call service in this is putrid.}{Logged a service request weeks ago and still no feedback. When calling the call Centre, I have been transferred to three different departments and no one is competent enough to help. No feedback at all. Not fair to call yourself world class city. Service request number **********}{I logged a faulty Fire Hydrant (Request **********) 24 Oct till to date no one has attend it and i have been calling their CallCenter for follow up and i keep hearing they will follow up with the depot.  it's so dirty in front of my house because of this water, what must i do to get assistance.}{It's been months now that our street in Newfields have been without lights. There is literally no lights on the pole due to it being ******, we have live wires hanging out and it's very dangerous for our kids. As a concerned citizen I lodged a complaint with the electric department and all I got was a reference number, up to date nothing has been done. People are being harassed when it's dark ,we had an incident where a young girl was almost ******ed going to the local ****a shop at night. We never had anything like this happen in our road before because we had street lights, which was some kind of deterrent for these unruly ****s going around robbing, breaking in and harassing our kids and even some of our elderly get ******. I really and truly hope that something gets done for the sake of our youngsters and all the people in the road and whole neighborhood.}{My experience with city of Cape-town is *********, I reported in January 2023 about the tree that was an obstruction on my drive way in such a way that it was difficult to reverse out of the garage without having to swerve the car and a it was causing fights between me and my neighbor, the other one is a big tree that is already damaging the road by its roots and messing my yard continously, I had to make uncountable calls for them to speed up the reaction of removing the trees, it took them ages just to come do the inspection, after that inspection took them another 2 months to respond on what would be the way forward, recently towards end of October, they sent a letter to say they will come trim the tree obstructing my drive way but they will not remove the bigger one that is damaging the road and messing my yard their reason being that the tree is healthy, what kind of nonsense is that? Even today I'm still asking myself who on his right mind can write such an idiotic statement.}{In terms of resolving the change of address issue they probably deserve 5 stars, but I was ignored when it comes to the pertinent question I asked which still bothers me to some extent and have never been provided with proper feedback. That is the issue of the water bill being perhaps modelled on the address incorrect address identifying my property and points to another plot because at some point 2019 or so my water bill just shot up exponentially.}{I've send an email to get some outstanding municipal accounts forwarded to me. Outstanding for 3 months in 2022 due to Postal services-strike.
This morning,1 call to their Accounts Department,spoke to Lindi,within 10 min.the copies were sent to my email. Ref. **********.
5/5 for all assistance, friendly and in Afrikaans.}{Newlands swimming pool has now been closed almost continually for 10 years!  10 years and the pool has still not been repaired!  I have tried to contact Cllr Mikhail Manuel, who occasionally answers my emails, but never returns my calls.  I don't know what to say about this anymore....except to say that I will be voting for a different party in the upcoming elections!}{I bought a vehicle and drove it for a bit but soon after decided to sell it off.  I then did a rent to own with a gentleman that is from Zimbabwe. He subsequently got a fine and they kept on sending me sms's.  I later went to Greenpoint to see them and ask how can i have this redirected to the person resposible.  They gave me a huge list to run around and i then did it. It took me a while to collect all the paperwork in the order they want it, police affidavids etc.  Its like SAPS asking you to find the ******** first with the ****** items before they can help.  After I met their unrealistic expectations, they informed me that they cannot send the information to this person because he is not a SA citizen.  This being, after he bought a house etc. This is the disconnectedness of the people making  bylaws with absolutely no logic of the real world.  But then again, we work to pay tax so they can get paid but they dont work to help what is happening on the ground.  City does not work for anyone other than the selected.}{Our water was shut off by CoCT on Tuesday, 17 October 2023, without warning or valid reason. Our account is up to date. We logged the fault with the CoCT Water Department on the same day. It is Thursday, 19 October 2023. We are going onto our third day with no water and nobody has been sent out to assist with resolving the problem. You have to wonder is this the way the CoCT treats paying customers? We have called numerous times to follow up and all we get is that the operator has no control of the situation as they are dependent on external contractors. This is deplorable service from CoCT. To think we moved to Cape Town under what is now a false pretense that a DA run province is far more efficient than the alternative. Sad to say, there is not much difference.}{The City installed a new water meter without informing us on Wednesday. They never checked that it was installed correctly with the result that we have no water. We logged a call on Wed and were told someone would come on Thursday (within 24). No one came but the case was marked as closed. When we called back asking why it was closed the agent said it's just on their side but the depot will still attend to the matter. When we called again Thursday evening to check up when this will be resolved the new agent said but the case is closed we need to log a new case and this means we need to wait another 24 hours. It is now 48 hours without water due to a faulty and shoddy service provided but the City of Cape Town and no one can give us any indication when we will get our water turned back on. So the fact that we logged the call on Wed and was closed in error has no bearing at all - they only considering our last referenced nr and we need to wait. This is a shocking service from the City that Works for you. 
I understand that there is a process that needs to be followed but the City let us down by:
 - not informing us that a new meter will be installed
 - not doing a check to make sure that the new meter is working correctly
- Closing the call incorrectly
- Agents giving us the wrong information saying that although it is closed on their end they are still attending to the matter - we wasted valuable time here.
- Inconsistent communication - one agent saying they will come in the morning to the next person saying but they can't see a job card. 

Really expected more from the City of Cape Town.}{On the 12th of October my water was cut off. The letter that was issued was actually meant for the house a few doors down. We notified the City that the incorrect house's water was cut off. But was told we'll have to wait. No one can say when our water will be turned back on. I hardly think it's fair that a paying rates payer should be punished for the actions of the City's *********** staff.}{City of cape town decided to cut my water because on the 3rd of October, I found out on the 4th that is was because I'm in arrears of r4000, with out giving me any notice of arrears or notice to make payment they cut the water, I made payment on the 4th and contacted them several time since then it's more than 48 hours and I'm still waiting for the water to get connected}{City of Cape Town you have a very horrible service delivery and your call center agents are extremely rude and not helpful.

I've been without water for 3 days and I am the only one in my area. I called your call center line on Sunday and was promised to be helped within 48hrs. My 48hrs lapsed this morning and no agent has come to my house to have a look at my water meter box.

You are infringing my basic human rights. I can't cook, bath no drink water. I have a baby and a small child in the house. How do you expect me to survive with my family in such conditions? 

My rates are up-to-date and I've never missed a single payment. Yet here I am with no water and recieving zero assistance. Tomorrow will be my fourth day without water. I'm beyond disgusted, this is the cruelest form of **************.

All your agents do is tell me to wait and that they don't know when I'll be helped. This is ridiculous!

You always say City of Cape Town works for it's residence, why are you not working for me? Why is my water off yet I pay my rates?}{When I renew a license disk via ENATIS, it takes about 4/5 days.
Every time I renew my license disk via COCT, it takes 2 months.

Right now I am waiting for almost 2 months to get my disk and after 5 unanswered mails, I am still waiting.

Not sure why they get paid to do "work" . . .}{Brilliant service by the City and Durbanville Municipal Office. 
I renewed 2 car licences mid July via the city's e-services. After not having received anything for 2 months courtesy of the Post Office, I followed up via email. Received a response in 1 day to say that my licences were dispatched basically a day after. I called the number and spoke to Sisonke. She asked me to hold on while she was trying to sort it and then said, that Mr Matikane would call me back to arrange for collection. He called within an hour and arranged for me to collect my licenses from Durbanville Municipal Office, arranged with Cheslyn Fredericks my collection. Went to collect the following day and was again blown away by the friendly, efficient service,
World class service - Thank You!!!}{I have been out of power for almost a month now, the cable has been damaged as well. The power technicians that came to check said the meter number I have doesn't correspond with the pole of which I was given the the new meter box by City technician about 4months ago. Mind you I have been paying debt for this meter number I have and have been contacting the city power via email and calls, but nothing has been done instead I have been given different reference numbers, it has come to my attention that this city is not working for me. This is the last reference ********** I got last Friday. My house is at 2051 Nomaweni Street, Browns Farm}{On about the 23rd August 2023 the City of Cape Town responded to a complaint from my neighbour at 10 Berg Street Gordon’s Bay to the sewer pipes being blocked, which has happened on an increasingly regular basis, and when they put water through the system it blew back through my plugs and outlet pipes.

They then came through to my property, 23 Miller Road Gordon’s Bay, and put a plunger rod down one of the pipes and high pressure water. On both occasions the bricks on the pavement lifted and sewer flowed into the street.They informed me that the pipe was broken and a CoCT team would need to come out and replace the pipe and that I should log in a further complaint.

I have reported it and disputed the closure each time, with the logging and the closure being on the same day so no chance of physical checking. 

********** marked as closed on 31st August **********8257 marked as closed on 5th September **********9424 marked as closed on 6th September **********0293 marked as closed on 12th September 2023

I also sent an email to Councillor Sean Stacey and his assistant Helene Wilson and not even an acknowledgement. One person has tripped on the sunken bricks and hurt themselves.

How long will it take CoCT to send a team to fix the problem. Every time a toilet is flushed in either of the two units sewage flows into the street.}{The content below represents my email of the 23/08/2023 to the COCT Water Department in regards a technical water related query. Subsequent to my email, I received an email indicating that I would receive a response within 7 days. In spite of phoning numerous times I have had no feedback.

By introduction my name is Doug Mc Dougall and I am the body corporate chairman of an apartment Block in Fish Hoek.
Our apartment block consists of 6 apartments on the ground floor and 6 apartments on the first floor. The geysers for the apartments on the first floor are housed in the roof voids above the apartment ceilings. The geysers are supported by roof trusses and mounted on drip trays that are connected to drain pipes which discharge to the outside of the building in accordance with SANS 10254: 2012.
The geysers for the apartments on the ground floor are situated in kitchens, and are bolted to the kitchen walls and encased in wooden boxes which visually appear to be part of the kitchen cupboards.
It is extremely difficult to comply with SANS 10254: 2012 in regards a drip tray / drain pipe for the geysers on the ground floor.
My question in regards the geysers on the ground floor is as follows:
When a registered plumber either issues a COCT Certificate of Approval for a newly completed / altered water installation, or a COCT Certificate of Compliance of a water installation on transfer of ownership must he ensure that a drip tray / drain pipe is installed or is this requirement not necessary and can be overlooked.

Doug Mc Dougall}{We have been unable to purchase electricity for 7 Years, we have been through different departments of the city and each time we are given different reference numbers with no assistance. In 2016 we informed the municipality of the closure of our business due to the high electricity tariff that we were under which was small tariff 1 (Commercial) and asked to be downgraded to residential since the business had been closed. Amongst other things that led to the business being shut was that the city made it impossible to have or operate our business, They once slapped us with a R22K fine saying that our electricity was *******, meanwhile, it was the same municipality people who came to do our connections and in their last visit they said that they will come back as they picked up that our electricity was being ****** by ******* connections from nearby squatters. Since then we have never seen them coming back to fix the issue, but we have had to close down our only income as we were unable to pay the exorbitant fees on fines by the city due to failure to do the right thing regarding our line and the surrounding nearby area. We have been to every department and every time a ticket is created, we would get calls from the city that never went anywhere because each time a new person on a new ticket will act like they will assisting, but unfortunately, they will  disappear, just the same as everyone else has done from the city. 
They asked us to do an affidavit stating that we really closed the business, post that they would send their inspectors to check if the business was indeed closed. The inspectors came to check, but till this day nothing has been done, however, we still haven’t been able to purchase electricity and have been without it since 2016, but have been at the mercy of our neighbours who allowed us to connect a line to their houses.
I recently went to their Plumstead offices in which a new ticket/ reference number ********** was created and all the system you could see all the tickets dated back to 2017. On the 10th of August 2023 they sent someone from evaluations to come verify again that the business is closed and took pictures and after that we got a call that we need to pay R9500 in service fees for them to be able to downgrade us to residential, Mind you, since the closure of the business, we our household currently has no income and the same municipality (Working for the people) is expecting us to pay so much money, after travel fees and communications to the City with no assistance where and how are we expected to come up with so much money?}{As usual, I submitted my 2 vehicle license renewals online at the beginning of August 2023. I paid online and have the reference numbers.
It is now early September and no new licenses have been delivered.
After a long wait and longer chat to the call centre, they say it is the fault of the post office.
If indeed this is the case, then the system is not working. It seems that I will have to put in more effort to resolve this. The COCT is responsible for the end to end system. They should resolve my problem!}{Do you not have a heart?????

My parents who are elderly have been without electricity since the evening of the 30/08/2023. Ticket was logged and reference was received **********. I was told that the technicians will come out the next day. It is now the 01/09/2023 13:56 to be exact and no one has come out.

I sent an email yesterday 31/08/2023 to find out why no one has pitched, I then received a response from Jade Hawyn advising that their depots are inundated with active service request due to the recent weather and load shedding constraints. Sent yet another email today and no response was received.

We emailed, smsed, and phone the city of Cape Town on a daily basis and always received the same automated response of them being inundated with loads of reports due to weather conditions. After 10 days of being ignored, they finally sent people to have a look at the problem last Friday the 7th of July 2023. We again had the same electricity fault on Sunday the 9th of July. We again reported the fault. We received a response Monday morning from a Jade Hawyn who advised a team had been dispatched to our area. Nothing happened on the 10th of July. I again sent a report request on the 11th of July and had to provide the same info of where I reside and I was given a reference number. Last night one of the electricity power poles caught fire. The City OF CAPE TOWN still has not arrived to have a look at the problem. 

I reside in Samora Machel. The CITY of CAPE TOWN does not care about its lower-class citizens. I shudder to think that residents in the more affluent areas receive the same lack of care and service. We pay for electricity just like all the residents in Cape town and our plight should be given the same urgency. DO BETTER Geordin HILL and employees. Treat everyone equally}{You know the city of cape town is so ****** OVERATED,just because it has this elite fiamilies,and elite ty****s that believe that the Western Cape is theirs,they have all privilleges,they live better in better neighbourhoods,and they are the minority of the province,so I have been residing in the mont clair,the area falling under Mitchell's plain ,and lived here with my family,2014 I bought a new development and believed that I might have a chance in receiving better quality of service from the ***on city,in the beginning I was given someone's meter number,the system had my municipal account mixed with this other guy in my neighbourhood,I tried resolving the matter,and the city said No Worries,the problem will be fixed,till today.
In 2021 I had a burst in my yard,that resulted in municipal arrears as it was not visible,hidden under the pavement,I requested a rebate and submitted all paperwork after fixing the problem.Rebate never return to date.
At the time municipal account was billed R2000 and some sort,today its R7000,mind you,I never skipped any payment,they have been closing my water,I complain they come after God knows how many days.There was a time when I asked about the electricity units,they taxed me extra because of the tenants next door,as I mentioned that at the beginning,when we moved in,the meter number that we had was not ours.The tenants did not pay municipality,but then they were not taxed,it was me who was being harrased by the City.
This year after many many attempts and all the visits to the City,I still experience a problem,where after every Loadshedding my house power electricity do not return,the whole neighbourhood has the power,even both next door families,and front plus back opposite,Where does this put me as a Law abiding citizen???????It is a ****ty situation,I cannot do anything anymore,but just wait for the city,WHAT THE **** MARA}{Poor service delivery, am so disgusted it's a been whole good damn week since, I reported that my electricity box is faulty en we been sitting in a dark house without electricity for a week.

On 21 June I requested a copy of an invoice they should have sent me at the beginning of June. I received the 7 working day response almost instantaneously, but nothing since then. It is a relatively easy task to get a copy invoice out of the SAP system - it shouldn't take 7 days.}{The power was out at only my house from early yesterday morning. I logged a fault on My Smart City at 9am. I was so impressed - they were here around 12 and it was resolved by 13h00 - broken overhead wires due to the high winds the night before.

The traffic police are controlling the traffic, but nobody is fixing broken traffic lights.}{On Saturday 17 June 2023 at 8h00 am our electricity box blew due to a water leakage which led to us having no power, we logged a claim with our insurance who messed us around all day (as they do - FYI Standard Bank insurance, no surprises here. There is a separate complaint posted regarding them), so much that we were forced to seek an electrician directly while also fixing our leakage and water damage personally. While the electrician worked at trying to fix our predicament, the damage was so bad that the outside electric box tripped and we were forced to log a call for CoCT to come out and switch the power from the box outside back on, a simple task; unlock box, flip the switch leave so that our electrician can do his job. CoCT initially told us that it would take 4 to 6 hours for someone to come out - this was at 18h00 which mean't they'd come at 0h00 that night. Nobody came. The next day, when following up with the city that works for you, we were told that we were given a generic response the night before and that it was negligence on their part due to the influx of calls due to the current Cape Town floods but that they will make sure someone comes through that day (Sunday, 18 June - still no electricity) Sunday came and went and it's now Monday, 19 June - 63 hrs with zero electricity. We are a small family of 3 with a little toddler who is only 2.5 yrs old, it's cold, we have responsibilities that are dependent on electricity including one of us working from home and needing power. We are tax paying citizens who always pay their rates and water on time, abide by the law and this is how we are treated. Highly disappointed and disgusted. So here we continue to sit in the dark waiting...}{Dear Customer. CCT Service Request ********** for Street Lights - All Lights Out has been logged.

The above call out was logged on Saturday 10th June @10:00am. Someone very neatly cut the flimsy ribben closing the street light. And proceeded to cut the wires and walked off. Nothing seems to have been taken. It's a very busy point in the street and has been the site of armed ******ies before due to the quiet nature of the area and this spot leading to the point of public transport access. In addition the light around the corner has also been knocked out. The old couple living opposite the corner had their solar geyser panel ****** not too long ago using this route. All of this was conveyed to the call center agent. It's now 9 days later and not a single update. When one tries to call in there's a 37minute wait time. Previously a drain blocked on the exact corner and it took 3 weeks for a vehicle to be sent. Only after notifying the ward councilor of the area. Why does one need to go to such extremes for the City to do what it claims proudly to do in excellence. The logo should be changed to "the City that works for a few."}{I am appalled at the City's Customer Service. The power in one section of my road went off around 1am and we initially thought it was loadshedding. But when I woke up at 8am with no power still, I realised there is a problem with the power. I immediately called the city's call centre and was placed on hold, this was at 0805. Initially I was told waiting period is 37min or alternatively I could send an sms and leave contact details. I chose to hold and also sent an sms. It's now 1hour 30min and I am still holding. No response to my sms and my place in the queue is stuck on 8 for the past 42min. This is really pathetic service. It is not like it's free for me to call the city. I need to know why I don't have power and for the city to fix it soonest. I pay my rates on time so that I can get better service than this. This is not acceptable.}{Hi,

I have sent emails and SMSs regarding our power box which has been faulty and many workers have came to check on it , it have been reported internally also for the box to be closed yet no action has been done yet.

Clearly their turnaround time of 24 doesn't doesn't and I don't know why they call it emergencies because they don't treat it as urgent.

All the call center is telling me someone has been out but the damn drains is still overflowing.

No one from the city came out to unblock the main drain which is infront of no2 Altona grove woodstock 7925.

I am writing to bring to your attention the power outage that has affected my Father, Mr. City of cape town has given us no for the past three days. My father has several health issues, and the lack of electricity has made it difficult for him to manage his condition.

We have learned that many other users in our area have been experiencing power outages since April 26, 2023. We understand that the electricity department is currently understaffed and that they have provided us with an incident reference number, **********, to log our complaint.

However, when I spoke with Portia Nune from the electricity department, she informed me that the only action she can take is to follow up on our complaint, which is not sufficient under the circumstances.

Therefore, I urgently request a team to be sent to our location to address this power issue as soon as possible. It is critical that this matter is resolved promptly as my father health is at risk.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Valerie}{Four stars to response to initial enquiry and thereafter two stars is generous.  I have had a dispute lodged against my building on a boundary. The basis for the objection of one neighbour (who is least impacted) is really of little substance, yet my building has been stopped for over a year now.  In the meantime, most of the building materials I purchased are damaged and much of the material will need to be bought  again due to the damage.  The building is roof height now.  Tygerberg sent it to a tribunal in Cape Town  and as yet there is still no answer.  It really is quite straight forward and should not require much adjudication and yet over 1 year later and we are still waiting.  How long does one need to wait before we get an answer?  How long are we expected to wait in the face of a neighbour who expects us to guarantee that a prayer room will not be used for any other purposes?  Can a neighbour really expect to hold control over our land and what we do with it?  I want to understand from the municipality how long does a tribunal take and how many years are we expected to wait in limbo.  We fully acknowledge that we were in the wrong and have apologised but it seems that this is not sufficient.  I am now very tired of waiting and also apologising to someone who is intent on achieving what??}{Spent 30 minutes on a call, person told me they were going to get more info from their senior, she told me she way getting up assuming they needed to go look for their senior, never cane back.

I reside in Nyanga and loadshedding was scheduled for 18h00h00-20h00. Electricity came back few minutes after 20h00 and it went off again. I tried contacting them via sms and they responded with a reference number saying that they've logged a service request for "No power." I was then asked to send my address and the meter number and no one came back to me. I've been sitting and I really don't know what I can do in order for them to do something about this situation.}{Just a huge pat on the back for the traffic department in Cape Town civic center.

Paul Burger}{The City of Cape Town's DAMS (Development Application Management System) online upgrade of 2023 is abysmal. Writing on behalf of a qualified and experienced draughtman who has been dealing with the City of Cape Town and their application process for the last 25 years, I am appalled at the way the new online portal has been managed. For the last 3 months, the online portal has been offline for the majority of the time, making online submissions and online queries on existing projects impossible. How does the City of Cape Town, advise the public that the system is all well and functioning when in reality draughtman (who administer the process and submit the public requests) are restricted by a non-functioning portal that hamstrings their duties to their Clients and curtails their livelihoods (notwithstanding the livelihoods of building contractors, hardware suppliers and labourers in general). This essential service, paid for my the public, has been grossly mismanaged by the City of Cape Town. Where does the accountability sit? Has the public at large been informed and advised on why their tax paying Rands are being spent on a system which does not work for their good? The City of Cape Towns DAM system in comparison to the old manual hard copy submissions is totally inferior in terms of length of time to approval, previously 2 weeks, now 6 months +. The total internal mismanagement of town planners and plans examiners are a gross incompetence by the City of Cape Town, on a Eskom scale of deniability.}{We logged a sunken water meter problem on 11 March, they keep closing the query saying it is level with the tar, but it is not in tar and no one has been here. They have re captured the query the third time and when I asked on the whatsapp , they just say they are still in the right time frame 
So they are overstating their workload by closing queries that have not been attended to, these queries cannot be re opened and they log new ones when you follow up. This is dishonest and not what we expect from CTC}{For the past week I have had sewerage water overflowing from the manhole on my property. No one at the city of Cape Town seems to care. I logged a call which was closed without the issue being fixed I then logged 2 more calls. Eventually they arrived on Thursday only to tell me the problem is at the main pump somewhere. I was promised it would be fixed today but still nothing. I have sewerage water flowing out of my garage as well which is now inaccessible.

Dear Chrizelle Erasmus

Principal property inspector- Blauuwberg development management, spatial planning and environmental directorate 

Thank you so much for the great work you guys are doing in upholding the building design and overall quality standards in South Africa 

Thanks also to Frans and Vuyani that started the work 

No work is easy but I think yours is highly in popular 

I have rated the team three out of five unt resolution of my complaint that is before you

THE ******** ARREST OF 53 YEAR OLD  BLACK SKINNED FEMALE MEDICAL PRACTITIONER OVER ILEGAL STRUCTURE BY MILNERTON POLICE STATION 
CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.

Following my reaction to the ******* structure put up by my white neighbour, 24 August 2022, ISABEL was the first person I looked for and was told she is not on duty - what a strategy Isabel
I asked the property cafe reception to give me Isabel cell phone number and she rep**** no I cannot.

A delegation visited my property from the complex security management and undertake to report back and that was appreciated in good spirit. 

On 8 September 2022, I had serious banging on my door at 11pm only to realise through complex security that they were police men that informed security at the gate that they are going to 23 the Tuscans and not 24 the Tuscans ( my home )

Thereafter I came out, security at my door a bandit of policemen rocked up at my door wanting statements from me at 11pm but requested that the statement be taken at he police station with an assurance that they will bring me back immediately after the statement 

It never added up, however because I saw police van, I decided to respect the National minister of police and The President of the republic of South Africa whom the politically should be representing 

PLEASE ALLOW ME TO DIGRESS AS MILNERTON POLICE STATION ORDEAL WILL FOLLOW SHORTLY 

I WAS ASKED TO ENTER THE BLACK MARIA -police van after I requested the complex security to send a message in the trustee and property café management WhatsApp group 

Alias, the Milnerton Police men **** in the discharge of their duties as I was never brought back home
They wanted statements 
In jail after numerous finger print and signature that was never explained to me what I was signing, milnerton police station officials said now you are under arrest very shocking as I asked them two questions at my home before the complex security at.my door if I was under Areest and or need to call someone and they said NO

Sooner I knew I was dealing with dishonest uniformed and non uniformed police officers i carefully noted also that they kept saying to me to go and settle- I was confused police officers in the discharge of their duties is asking me to go and settle 

More to follow…………

Since 8 September 2022 to date, no one of century view trustees nor property cafe stopped my being taking away if indeed property cafe gave permission to Ryan Meaker of 23 the Tuscans to erected the ilegal structure especially as property cafe never mentioned that to me and this is despite my many complaints that I raised with them following the ******** arrest 

I have owned the property since transfer in January 2022 and the white neighbour 23 The Tuscans Ryan Meaker have not even moved into his property at that stage.

So it was good for the black skin to go to jail

****a Samsodien of 25 the Tuscans confessed that they were the ones that referenced me to the new white neighbour, I was shocked as she identified herself as an enemy, how can she ever have good reference about me 

Close look reveal from a lay man look that the other sides Ryan Meaker did were not looking bad but he left only mine in an ugly state, with cracks etc

Property cafe realtors office principal Mr. Karate was pressurised and he took me to use water and horse pipe to clean the fence for the white *** at 23 the Tuscans amazingly, he said it with his tail in between his legs, couldn’t make eye contact 

It seems to be correct that because the black man skin is mostly dark, we are as good as feacal matter and should be made to clean white mans feacal matter ironically 

When the time frame for Ryan Meaker to remove the structure in the lapas of the 60 days grace on the notice of contravention issued to white Ryan Meaker, my madam Clark threatened To phone my employer as they want me gong from my home… shortly after my employer phone.
No doubt the ********s bandits at century view have a previous and ongoing relationship with my employer 

Isabel office administrator now saying that she gave Ryan Meaker permission to erred ilegal structure of 1.8 meter in height thereabouts was well aware of the black female ******** arrest, property cafe never came in at that time to say please leave the doctor, don’t take doctor away for statement, if indeed the property cafe created the mess

Property café realtors- Julio is not unaware either but it was good for the black skin to go to jail

When the white *** must remove the ilegal structure my photos circulated to discredit me in other that property café realtors can represent Ryan Meaker and safe him from jail

Ingnorance of the law is no excuse - I am very clear on this

Isabel, Julio, please not that whatever is goiod for Peter is Gifford Paul 

Ryan Meaker must dance to the tune Kwaito that he matured and drink his own medicine in leaving the ilegal structure in a mess

The attempt of property café realtors to hide Ryan Meaker will fail and I will not leave a sine un - tuned

Any video and pictures of mine taken to damage my character and person will equally be challenged, to before warned is to before armed 

The above is a confirmation that IsBel act and that of property cafe realtors  directories by Julio is beyond, **************, better called ****** and then *****ulent approach to overtime the arm of justice 

Property café realtors you will  burn you fingers  should you continue to  assume that the white is first citizen in South Africa 

Please refrain from all such actions of taking sides between two resident quickly, because you are well aware that I am the complainant on the ******* fence, should you persist  to stand forRyan Meaker against myself thinking you will destroy me, you will not live to see the light of the day

I am back skinned 
I am an un repentant African 

This war you referred to will you is yet to start since 2020 will destroy you and all evil perpetrators 

You have no told me how many more ilegal structures are there still  in century view that Isabel permitted assuming the powers of the building inspector of the republic of South Africa, please provide the list with physical address

I have started my surveillance and will gladly inform the municipality so that that’s structures are thoroughly investigated and demolished 

Municipal process
Draw plan
Submit the plan to the municipality  with page that reveals that neighbourhood have seen the plan and hold no objections / decline
Building inspector will then arrange to come out on site to do the necessary and thereafter give a go ahead or not
On completion of work if go ahead is given, , building inspection Will have to come out again to check and sign off

Not a single one of the above did Ryan Meaker did - I am the next neighbour 

Shortly after Ryan Meaker was served contravention notice in the 69 days of grace, he called out a quantity surveyor 

The ilegal structure was done many months August 2022  how does the the building inspector determine his pre and post visit approval , are we just cooking the books plaster and paint is concluded

The municipality prosecutor on this mater is urged to do the right things upholding the rules of our rainbow nation South Africa 

No jokes Isabel I am definitely winning this all through with spares and Arrows- stay clear avoid stray bullect experience and let us see if the white *** is man enough !!

Property cafe sold out her almost 4 year non problematic client in my person to a newly arrive white *** that has made any business with property cafe 

Simply the colour of his skinned Isabel?

You choose to be in battle with the black skinned female medical doctor and despite all the bullying…… 
Property cafe there is no going back on my side ******s  / ****** and xenophobia must stop

After you orchestrated moves to get my finger prints in jail as an ilegal immigrant, as it was beyond the fence, you think I will be reduced to the those you force to pick up dog wastes?, no not at all

Please stay stunned: municipality and milnerton police station, Western Cape department of health as a package to follow : will be back shortly…

On 10 March 2023 City of Cape Town officials arrived at my grandparents home in Khayelitsha and  disconected the water the water supply. They left a notice letter with a reference number (**********99) with my grandfather and explained nothing further. On Monday the 13 my grandfather went to the municipal offices at Stocks n Stocks and was told he had to pay R3000.00 which we collected as siblings and gave to him to go and pay which he paid on 16 March 2023 and subsequently also negotiated for the remaining balance (which I also believe is ridiculously high - am told the meter reading  people don't even look at the  meter to read when they come, they thumb suck figures from looking at how expensive the house looks) Anyways,  he was told officials would be sent to come and reconnect the water, that same day. They arrived at night during load shedding and could not do any work and left. The following day the 17 March 2023 they arrived and did nothing as they said they could not find the actual water meter. 18 March I made numerous phone calls to being sent from pillar to post. One official was very off with me as he complained that I was calling his private number, eventually he subsided and called back to assist.  The officials came later that day and only then we were told that the meter had been removed and had been sent for investigation for tampering, and my grandfather would then have to apply for a new meter. The lady I spoke to on the phone later promised to send me the forms which I have not received till to date. I only received a sms with a reference saying a request had been logged. Ref **********. On the 20th my grandfather went to the Stocks n Stocks office and he was told he did not need to reapply and a team would be sent the same day to come and with a meter and reconnect, despite a promise that was made to me on the follow up call I made later that same day, they never pitched. On 21 March 2023 I made a follow up call and was again told a team had been dispatched with a meter to come and reconnect and they never pitched. Follow up Ref **********. Today 22 March 2023 my grandfather was again at the offices of Stocks n Stocks, later a team came with a meter eventually and again they left without doing any work as "they cannot find where they are supposed to connect the meter. 
The house is now without water for 12 days in total, unhealthy and unhygienic and especially for the elderly and the grandchildren. The service of the city towards an elderly has been appalling  and draining on an elderly person, where at times he says the officials were even dismissive and rude towards him. 
This is unacceptable at all. In a Country that prides itself of taking human right s seriously especially those of the elderly and children this is actually disgusting,not to mention the disgrace of bad behavior of a city that prides itself of being top n municipal delivery.}{I spoke to an agent Guliana Giasatto at Remax premier Clairmont, Cape Town, this lady was very unprofessional and refuse to assist me in buying a property.}{On the evening of Saturday, March 11th, I reported a blocked drain/sewerage issue at Hazeldean, Browns Farm (Philippi) to the city of cape town phone line, with the reference number **********. They assured me that the turnaround time for the job would be 24 hours. On Sunday afternoon, city officials or workers inspected the property and discovered that there was an issue with the main hole. They promised to arrive on Monday to fix it.

However, the officials or workers did not show up on Monday, which resulted in faeces and urine running all over the property. On Tuesday, I called the city contact centre again to escalate the issue and they provided me with a new reference number, **********.

Unfortunately, on Wednesday, there was still no sign of any officials or workers. I reached out to the City of Cape Town's Twitter page and WhatsApp channel, but all I received was the standard response that "it's being escalated." This has been an incredibly frustrating experience, and it's clear that the city officials are not being diligent or caring about areas with a certain population.

This situation is an attack on our dignity, and it's unacceptable that we cannot use our bathroom facilities for relief. It's disappointing that the city officials are not providing the necessary services effectively. It's evident that if this had occurred in Constantia or any affluent area, it would have been dealt with promptly. The notion that some animals are more important than others, as George Orwell stated in Animal Farm, seems to apply here.

I am not sure what else I can do. The issue needs to be resolved.}{The Safety and Security Component (Fire and Rescue Services) do have a rigid  Recruitment and Selection Process.

On the 31/01/2023 I sent a follow up email, however received o feedback.
On the 14/02/2023 I called to follow up, the guy I was talking to said the matter was resolved. I asked that he sent me the invoice to confirm. The invoice still showed the amount as outstanding. ref- **********.

Please fix this problem.}{I'm not getting anywhere with the city of cape town electricity department. As discussed previously,  I sold my property at  Gordons Bay, Cape Town.

Please refer to my email from 18th August 2022 with copies of the council bills of account **********90, account summary at 23rd July 2022.

 

Instead of receiving a pay-out, we were charged for a defective electricity meter, account **********03 (closed prepaid electricity account for BURNS ROAD 33A 33B, SALT RIVER).
However, we sold our property in burns road salt river, 7925 Cape Town, in 2015/2016 and the electricity meters were checked in that time and signed off. We can't be held accountable for electricity usage and a meter change in 2021, because the property  belongs to someone else. the new owner of the property should have been charged, and refund us the owed overpaid amounts. The transfer deeds clearly shows  from 2015 and 2016 we were not the owners of the property, as council should have rectified. 
. I expect that these charges will be reassigned to the true owner as soon as possible.
 I am trying to solve this matter for several months now. I would like to have this issue solved in the next weeks, but the council have been dragging there feet, and not taking responsibility you can phone the call center for 3 hours and when you get through, whoever is incapable of dealing with your issue properly, slams the phone in your ear. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me, if anyone can assist to escalate this matter.}{You guys need to update YOUR public about start times at the Civic instead of having YOUR public travel from far and wide to make use of your services, only to be told they start at 8AM.

We have logged a request with the City of Cape Town about the water issue..last week already. We did not have water for almost 3 weeks now...I know there is service level agreement but they took way too long to assist.

Then Call centre requested that we send the picture of the meter...the Plumbers/Depot guys went there to check and they stated there was nothing wrong..but still people do not have water up until today.

I have even sent an email to their OMBUDS, they requested my ID but still there is no water...available.. we have also done numerous calls..to the City.

We are not happy with the service 

Herewith is the call that was logged..

Good day,
 
I have logged a call on Wednesday 8th Feb 2023 that there is no water , and the people have not water for more than 8 days.
Only today that the City have sent the Plumbers/ Maintenance guys to check what was the issue after I have stated that I will escalate with complaints.
 
The call Centre requested that I need to take a picture of the meter...i did that and posted it on whatsaap messages. 
 
To cut the story short , maintenance people went there, they have diagnose the meter...it is not leaking. We did not log a call for water leakage. The call that was logged is that there is no water, so there is a miscommunication between the office staff and the maintenance people/ Plumbers  
 
 
Address : 10 Leretholi Street, Langa, 7455

Please assist on this matter as it is quite urgent , people are out of water more than 2 weeks now.
 
 
Looking forward to hear from you.

Just after midnight a team led by Kenneth arrived and fixed the problem which had to do with a connection outside the property being physically disrupted due to the pre-paid meter having been allowed to reach zero.

Good, honest people that are doing their jobs, even in difficult circumstances  gives me hope for our country.}{Customer service of City of Cape Town sucks I have been complaining since the 29th of November till to date without any help wanting them to to an open flow on water instead they have been ducking and diving with no help and they even lie and say they came to my property,I don't know what is that I have to do in order for them to take me seriously on top of that they are rude and I pay my rates without any hustle but they treat me like this I am really dissapointed😡}{The CoCT say they are here to serve their residents but in this case I am just knocking my head against brick walls.

I live in Barberton Street, Ravensmead 7493.
2 plots away from me, I think it may e 34b Barberton Street, Ravensmead, there is an overgrown plot with a foundation.
Water has been leaking from that plot for 5+ days now.

I logged reference number ********** and it was duly closed within a 3 hours.

The COCT call centre just says they cannot assist because the property does not belong to the council.
No one seems to know exactly who the owner of the property is.
In the meantime water is leaking and being wasted.

To me the CoCT should at least send out t team to investigate and then sort it out.
The CoCT keeps reminding us of potential water shortages and to be vigilant with water usage, but when water is wasted in this way they just don’t care.

I humbly request assistance with this matter.}{In the Kenilworth area we have had a very poor water pressure for over a month. Our neighbourhood have been complaining to the Water Board which are ignoring the problem. First we were told they were checking the water pressure, that was over a month ago, and since then the water pressure is useless. A trickle out the shower. Saturday and Sunday were back to normal but Mon to Fri its back to a trickle. No-one is giving a reason and when you ask them they keep referring to "they" and when you ask who "they' are they don't know. It's shocking that one cannot get a service from our city.

I put through another service request through on the 14th of November & advise still waiting. In the meantime our water bill is running sky high & because lack of service will need to pay the damage of a high water bill. Can see they came to do a reading yesterday for our next bill, which we dont know how they can see the meter with all the water...so the bill will probably not be correct either, but yet we will still need to pay it.

Having visited The Liberty Promenade Vehicle Licencing offices on a few occasions I was amazed at the level of service dished out by a young colored male counter assistant. The gentleman acts with a complete lack of empathy and unbridled impunity. Sadly, one feels like you are visiting a location at Day Hospital! Unfortunately, I do not know the young man's name as no name tags are worn at those offices. I would be most happy to point out the gentleman should I have the privilege to speak to his Supervisor.

The man speaks to each and every client as loud as possible, allowing the rows of seated clients to listen to him berating most clients. It would seem that every second client is turned away from his window due to one or another issue. On many occasions, he will grab the client's papers and stride off to the back to "consult with his Supervisor". It would seem that on most occasions his Supervisor "has his back" which obviously fuels this young man's determination to berate and turn the client away.

Seated clients are whispering their displeasure at his treatment of others, but no one has the guts to say anything, because they will then perhaps also have a fault found with their paperwork. One can see clients approaching his window with trepidation, knowing chances are good they will be loudly shamed. The man takes great pleasure in shoving your sheaf of paperwork back under the counter and dismisses you. I have observed the young man take his break whilst standing in the snaking queue which he has to pass; he then graces everyone with a disdainful grin and "rols" on his way like a gangster.

This man should be removed from providing a tyrannical service to the "peasants" of Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha, and its surrounds. He sincerely lacks the empathy to deal with his "perceived" low-level clientele. Perhaps a Customer Service Center near Bishops Court would better suit his delusions of grandeur! I am 66 years old and have been in Hospitality my entire life. I grew up in the crux of Apartheid, therefore the experience at Liberty Promenade was absolute "De Javu". 

I would absolutely relish the opportunity of training the Customer Service Personnel of the City of Cape Town free of charge! We DO NOT deserve this level of Service. Please do Something, City of Cape Town.}{Between the departments of Customer Care, Accounts and Water, it has taken 10 months and countless e-mail and telephonic forms of communication to settle a water account dispute.

HIGH WATER BILL :

In 2018 I settled my bill in totally. It is now year 2022 and my Bill is on +- 14 thousand. This is ridiculous I stay with my 14 and 4year old kids only in this house, mind you during the day no one is at home and I don't even water my lawn. How come I get billed so much High ???


When I noticed a wet and damp sand, particularly if the weather was dry, I reported the leakage because when the revue come to read my meters I have also noticed it was heavily leaking and counting very fast, I then logged a call and got this Ref ********** on the 24 May 2021  reported as Heavy Leak at the Water Meter.


WATER CUT :

I then noticed nearly 10 000 gallons of water are being wasted every year, until the day they closed my water completely and I had to go negotiate and paid R4000 at Bellville Civic Centre and made arrangement of paying off monthly my balance because none of the Clerks wanted to listen to my story, even if I quoted my Ref numbers to state the facts on my complain, I again reported the faulty leaking meter and insisted it was not private because on their records its said someone lied and said they came to my house and checked my meter the was no leakage, so to them I sounded as if I neglected my account and didn't pay the huge bill deliberately, I was then forced to pay the R 4000 I DID NOT HAVE....Remember I have small kids I could not survived a day without water I borrowed the money and paid.

I then continue paying as arranged but still nothing was done to fix this leakage, I am now furious and angry. Last week fortunately the weather was dry and the revenue guy came to read my meter, he then also saw the leakage and even took a picture of the wet meter stating someone will come and fix it. I am very much disappointed and I would like my account billing to be reconciled actually to be written off will all interest completely until this has been resolved. I would never pay Huge amount of money again until all the interest added has been taken off since ever my meter leaked. At least your readings and billing calculation should have shown how faulty my meter was, but someone is just not doing their job correct.


INVESTIGATION :

On my account you guys have (Estimated reading) HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN "ESTIMATING" if you come and do the proper readings monthly ? You have been billing me TWO accounts 1. Vacant evern charge and 2. Water why?  I need a calendar of all my reading dates. This needs to be under Dunning Lock until your investigation is finished.

I was told it will take an hour to 24 hours to attend the issue, mind you we could not use the toilet and sinks due to being blocked. 24 hours passed with no one being assigned even though I called numerous times to follow up, no one seemed to care they just kept on sending useless escalation sms. The following day I was told that my issue was assigned to Seigio Bezock who didn’t bother to attend to the matter, we had to constantly drive to the mall to use the toilet even at night with the kids.

I reported this via the City website. The matter was thrown around between the Traffic and Transport departments without solving the problem. At last I contacted the Mayor's office. Transport then advised that this intersection actually falls under the authority of the Western Cape Government, and was reported to them.Eventually the robot was repaired more than 6 weeks later.

Early in June 2022 the traffic light went down again. I reported same on 23 June 2022, via the website again. After nothing was done, I communicated with the Transport dept. again. I was told by Marlise Kiewietz that the repairing started on 25 June already. However. Nothing happened, and more than a week later, I contacted the Mayor's office once more. Still nothing happened, and due to the heavy traffic on the N2 at the intersection, I contacted the Premier's office. Guess what. I received a reply saying they trust that the Mayor's office would respond.

I then received an email advising me that an Eskom cable was damaged. The Provincial Government is not responsible for the repairing. Up till now the traffic light is still not repaired, and the traffic remains a nightmare at the intersection.

This makes one wonders if this deplorable service would have happenned just before an election. Most people are aware of the almost non-existing service delivery by Local Government in other provinces in our country. Sadly it seems that the Western Province Government is following the same route. Would be quite interesting to hear the comments of the DA leaders should they be asked in public about this unfortunate situation.}{Dear sir/madam

The seller's municipal account has still not been closed. This should have happened within weeks. There is no-one to correspond with -  you have to phone a call centre and repeat yourself to different people and end up having to resubmit documents over and over.  The DA purports to run local governments effectively but there is a vacuum somewhere in the City of Cape Town to do with rates and valuations where everything simply dies.}{If lived in Joburg, where you submit a building an it took 29 days to get approved, coming to cape Town its been almost 3 month and nothing yet you guys stink!!!!

My line was noted to be blocked on Sunday the 10th of April 2022.

I had Drain blasters come out at my personal cost to try and clear the line, but the blockage is to far into the main municipal sewer line and they may not access it as it belongs to the city of Cape Town.

I then logged a complaint and the city came out with a Bakkie and later the same day on Monday the 11th of April with a Truck to try and clear the line by entering the sewer line from my property.

They could not find the municipal access point and could not clear the blockage. The called for a senior to come with a plan, who arrived on Tuesday the 11th of April and looked around for 5 Minutes and left.

Each call made thereafter has had the situation escalated, but still not resolved as no-one has come out since. 

My line is blocked, overflowing internally and all facilities in the house can not be used. (Toilets, shower, wash basins, etc.)

The situation worsens by the day. Today is the 15th of April 2022. (The municipal sewer line has now been completely blocked for 6 days)

Firstly I wasted R100 airtime to get through to them as they keep putting you on hold then when I eventually get through they just give me a reference number I have been logging calls sending emails since Tuesday and it's Thursday evening and our electricity is still not on they just send reference numbers and say we must wait but I mean it's literally been 3 days that we have been without electricity because our meter box is completely dead after we had load shedding which suppose to last 2 hours but lead to 3 days and the saddest part is we have sick elderly people and babies still drink formula in the house and we unable to see to them the way we suppose to cause we don't have any electricity.i am so angry as you guys expect monthly payments for rates and things but you can't even come out and see what's happening they want to say the Meter box is vandelised how do you know that but the grass is growing high over the meter box if any body wanted to vandelise it they would need a lawn mower first cause that grass needs to be cut to even reach there.and I'm sure u have over enough staff to send out to check what's happening I need this issue to be resolved soon cause 3 days in the dark without warm food an water is no joke I've got elderly sick parents and babies in the house drinking formula and they have been in the dark for 3 days now it's not a joke you guys give pathetic service}{Is there any reason the massive sprinklers at Jan Burger sports complex run for 3 to 4 hours between 11AM and 4PM when the public was advised to water their gardens in the morning in the latest newsletter?}{We are renting in Constantia Cape Town.

ALL I want is to be able to view my municipal rates and taxes online for a house I own in a company.  Firstly I had to verify my status (fair enough), then register as an administrator and then link this administrative roll to me as a person (near impossible with multiple links and activation steps... really ridiculous SAP nonsense steps).  I still can't activate anything and now hope they send it via email... because getting them to change my email address between the various roles was also an apparent Herculean task -  now some emails refer to my old work address and others to the new email address... who knows what will arrive where. The whole platform is a SAP mess; 2 stars simply because they at least try and answer emails (albeit with illegible and convoluted instructions to follow).}{Our water pressure has been low since Monday 28 March 2022. I logged a fault on Tuesday 29 March 2022 and have been waiting for the city to send someone. The pressure is so low that we can't use the water to wash or do any washing. The call center keeps apologising saying they can't do anything.

I have called back a few times and I kept being told that I need to wait up to 5 days (which has passed) and that they can't say when someone will come out. How does the city not know the schedule for checking faults?

After no one showed up, I had to call the city again to escalate the fault and they still can't say when it will be attended to.

This is unacceptable to expect tax paying citizens to wait 5 days for service. The city works for itself and does not care about serving us. How can we be expected to wait until it eventually gets sorted out.}{My problem started in 2016 Started getting bigger and bigger bills Went to see them said meter is right must pay The account was standing at 220000 Surly accounts can see something drastic LG wrong Then I fitted in line meter I bought to check and difference was huge.One of the inspector came and looked at it Just walked of and said he would contact me He never even had us put water on th show differences in reading .Wenr with my son in law and they said I have to pay 15000 before they would put electricity on .Both fridge and freezer all food went off had to Chuck well over 1000 rand .Then we paid extra every month but they cut electricity again More spoiled food chucked away .Then in November someone stole tap end off .Called water leaks Took two hours to get there and could not find valve to turn water off Plumber arrived and took spannervand turned water of at the meter He’s said meter faulty and will fit new one.This happened and they said they would monitor usage for three months First month 98 rand next month 140 Next month ,170 had to top up pool .Then I started working out figures .Including sewerage I got to figure of over 77000 rand.They sent letter saying they would credit me Got next month account 45000 credit .???Now it has started all over gain 7000 rand 9000 rand and more Account was sitting at twenty thousandI sold all

It seems to me that the municipality has decided that these units are needed at households, but are not prepared to fit the bill for it, so they send the inspection team out (which they subcontract) - to leave the owners with an "Instruction To Repair" under threat of their electricity being cut if they do not effect said "repairs".

To me, this looks like a situation where the provision of an essential service is being held over individuals heads to force them to do additional work that has been deemed necessary by the municipality.}{The City's service system debited our bank account on 1 day 12 times with 12 random transactions to the value of R 80 000.

After checking the internet and finding out how the process goes, I followed it, but when it came to punching in my token code I kept receiving a reject error code. After much frustration, I reluctantly called the City of Cape Town offices to see if they could help me. Now,  let's be honest, one does not always get the best service from government departments, but let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised yesterday. I called the office at 15:40, and after explaining my issue and the consultant not being able to assist me, she said she would log a call with the technicians to come and see what the problem could be. I received an SMS to say the request was logged straight after my call at 15:48, a minute later to say it was registered, 5 minutes later to say it was in progress and the technicians actually arrived at around 5 pm and sorted it out with no issues.

This past Saturday morning I noticed water streaming into the local main road, Marine Drive. It looked to me like a burst water pipe, and I attempted to telephonically report it to City of Cape Town Water on the phone number provided in their website. This however does not work - I was cut off on two occasions whilst waiting to speak to someone. I then sent a message to the email address provided on the website, reporting the fault. Shortly afterwards I deduced from the smell that it was in fact a sewerage pipe that had burst, not just a water pipe, and I informed the City accordingly via email. I was quite a major mess, because the busy Saturday traffic was dispersing the sewerage along Marine Drive.

A little more than two hours later working crews and vehicles arrived, repaired the fault and cleaned up the area speedily and professionally. I was furthermore conitnually kept up to date via email.

Well done, City of Cape Town, this is how a well run Municipality should operate. You need to give attention to the answering of your telephones though.

Below is a brief summary of the situation:
She acquired the current property she lives at, after her divorce in 2019. She has paid her account every month for since 2019, as she doesn't want to end up with any legal action against her name. She struggled to change the account holders name on her Municipality invoice. After multiple phone calls and sending multiple emails with proof of ownership, her ID and all the required documents to City of Cape Town accounts department, it was done incorrectly. the City of Cape Town has closed the account she was paying on and created a new account which states that she now owes City of Cape Town a massive amount of R18414.12 (she initially received a SMS stating this amount). After contacting the City of Cape Town telephonically / through email explaining the issue and in the hopes of clearing up this mess, the City of Cape Town consultants bluntly stated that she needs to supply proof of all payments made towards the previously mentioned closed account and that she is liable for this outrages amount. IF the previous account had a zero balance and was paid for multiple years, who do they think was paying this account? We refuse to spend more money to pull bank statements for over two years, just because City of Cape Town messed up.
This is an unacceptable way of treating a loyal elderly account payer. We have contacted our ward councilor, in the hopes that this can be settled in a professional manner, but we will be forced to take further action if this continues to drag out and become and issue.}{It is a shame when you hear about how the City of Cape Town always beating its chest claiming to be the best in service delivery when they cannot even fix a prepaid electricity meter box that they made us get.

Hi CCT Ombudman,


Please see request below for Septic Tank cleanout request.
This request has not been tended to since last Sunday (8 days ago).
No service delivery - not even a  'This is why we are late'.

I have asked before is it possible for the Ombudman to do something to ensure the CCT does not neglect this vital and critical duty again, but here I am again.

Can I ask one more time if this can be seen to by no later than tomorrow please and is there a way for the long delay in service from CCT to be dealt with please?

A security guard then told us that they had, had a COVID case and that the offices will only open again in the afternoon. (This was not indicated anywhere to inform people). I went back that afternoon only to find that the offices were still closed. I went back a few days later but the queue was way too long so I drove to the Durbanville offices. The queue there was long as well and when I arrived there at  +/-15:00, I was informed that they have closed the queues and that I will not be helped that day. I should return on 18 December as they will open at 07:30. I put in a day's leave from work and arrived there at 7:15 on 18 December and joined what was a fairly long queue at that stage already. I spent more than 3 hours in the queue outside in the sun before gaining access to the building and then another 15 to 20 minutes before actually getting the licence renewed. The explanation I received was that the queues are always long over December. I know this is the case because it is an issue, I experience every year. My feeling is that bad performance plus a good excuse does not equate to good performance. If there is an issue in December, plans should be made to address this. I have tried the option of paying someone to do it for me, last year but it is fairly expensive and with corruption the way it is, one can never be sure of what you will be getting. Why can the post offices in the Cape not be used as is the case in all other provinces or else additional staff should be contracted for December to make provision for this? Four hours of leave or no pay to renew a licence makes it very expensive as is driving from one municipality to the next to try and find a shorter queue.}{Ridiculous service from the City of Cape Town Water Department.
It has been almost a month since I reported a leaking water meter.  Twice I have logged a notification on the online C3 system and twice it has been closed.  
The leak is not big but trickling 24/7 and contrary to the City's policies about wasting water they refuse to fix it.
It is the City's responsibility to fix a leaking meter.
I pay my rates every month on time why am I not getting the service??}{Day 7 without water....and this after phoning twice sometimes three times a day for the past week! Escalating to senior management has also fallen of deaf ears!!

And if they not suppose to pick up dirt that they sweep and put it in their plastics that they sell for R20.Why must they throw it in our yards?Is it their job description?}{They did not pay the refund within 72 hours as advertised.  We had to phone them twice before Belinda help us.}{This week my staff whom I collect and provide transport to have been late by an hour due to the traffic officers pulling vehicles over in the morning.I am having to lose an hour of productivity from this each day which cost my company.

Its bad enough that the trains are no longer operating...covid and eskom.

I understand that they need to do their jobs but this is ridiculous they are their to provide the public with a service not a hindereance and quite a costly one its 15% less productive time each day I''m loosing because of this.

One or two days is manageable but even that is unacceptable and to be quite honest very uncaring that they are prepared to let people be an hour late for work so that they can fine people.

Its disrespectful and abusive of authority.Its been done in a very rude fashion.

Can you kindly see that this matter is strongly addressed.Its costing my company quite a bit of money in an already troubled and difficult time.

He told me come back later when the power is back on and i wasnt able because i had to be at work so i came back this morning on the 10.11.2021 and i was told i now have a warrant and i have to pay  (R500) there is millions of people in the system with fines that is not paying and here i am a law abiding citizen wanting to do the right things gets treated like this no wonder the people would rather just ignore these fines look at the horrible service i got from S Mbengu which he knew i was there by him he helped me to look me in my face and tell me I have to pay now 500 rand he didn't care weither i was there yesterday ...i guess there's no difference between the criminals Robbing people in the streets because that is exactly how i feel today like i am being robbed.....poor poor service}{City of Cape Town is supplying us with Electricity in Mfuleni, but our grid is connected to two areas, which is Area 1 & Area 13 which I found it that is really unfair to us other people still working from home, because when ever those area have load shedding we are also affected, as that sometimes I will get uptown 4 times load shedding in the same day. Whys is other Area's electricity grid is not connected to two area's. eg one of my colleague that is staying in Goodwood is link to area 13 and I am in Area 1 but we will have load shedding at the same time. why is that happening @CityofCapeTown because is area 13 has load shedding me in Mfuleni area 1 I also have load shedding and if Area 1 Mfuleni has load shedding Area 13 don't have cause I would call my colleague and ask and he will say power is still on by him. Why is city of cape town no protect us on the load shedding like it does the other area's cause sometimes it will be announce if Eskom is on a certain stage and we as city customers will be announces that the city is protecting us and our load shedding will only start on a certain time. Is it only customers in posh areas that is getting protected or are we all city of cape town customers as I pay my obligation to the city as a customer even though I stay in Mfuleni, but I am getting more load shedding's that the posh areas, as I have been monitoring this since load shedding started and I am standing up for this unfairness.}{CCT Service Request ********** for mowing was  logged on 1 July & 23 August request was closed, with no work being done.

The electricity issue has finally been attended to, but the water and sewerage saga continues...

One of the pipes are inside my property that city officials dug up and worked on , only to leave the problem worse than it started off with . My neighbours has been affected by this and despite numerous calls , contacting the area ward councillor the buck gets passed . They absolutely refuse to fix the problem that was created .

Shocked to my core of the service !}{I have on numerous occasions brought it to the City of Cape Town's attention that the storm water channel next to my house in Beethoven Crescent in Sonstraal Heights in Durbanville has not been cleaned out in two years, and when it rains, it causes a backwash onto the road and 4 houses in my complex have been affected. The ward councillor Gerhard Fourie has been aware of this problem, but as usual, nothing has happened. I received an email from a gentleman by the name of Faizel Alexander from the City of Cape Town referring me to the Kraaifontein office with a reference number. In my opinion it is the job and duty of the City of Cape Town to follow up and to correct this problem. Not to pass the buck onto a taxpayer and rates payer. What are these civil servants doing? On another matter, water is coming out of a manhole onto the road on a regular basis. It appears that this manhole belongs to Telkom and is used by an internet company by the name of Openserve. I believe that it is the City of Cape Town's job to uphold the law and sort this problem out. I have on two separate occasions recently been told that the problem is fixed, which is clearly not the case. Hopefully the City of Cape Town can do it's job and finally solve both of these problems and stop pushing people from pillar to post. I will report back on any progress.}{Had a power phase blow on the pole outside our house. Reported it on their website at around 8pm (when it happened). Got SMS confirmation within 20 minutes.

Keep the fires burning and continue to be a bright star in this gloomy night of economic melt down}{The City of Cape Town's electronic rates clearance system is in a complete mess. There are clearance waiting to be issued after receiving payment for up to 4 weeks now. Inquiries via email, telephone as well as their free format messaging system simply go unanswered. There must be thousands of property transactions that have come to a complete standstill and the result of this is there are thousands of people sitting in limbo waiting for the transactions to go through, people not being able to move home, collect their proceeds from the sale of their home which often is linked to the acquisition of another, the list of issues this is creating is literally endless. 

The irony in this is that the individuals that are bearing the backlash of this mammoth failure on the CoCT part are the people who's taxes contribute towards their salaries, keep things moving in the City. CoCT demands payment so we pay and get nothing in return not so much as an apology and we'll get this fixed for you instead we just get ignored. It's not like we asking them for favours, we paying for a service and getting nothing in return.

So i ask everyone out there, what is it we paying for?}{Unfortunately I have to give a star so that I can write a review,I would have given them zero!!!.My water meter's electronic solenoid valve is broken so there is no water coming to my house since Friday 1/10/2021.Phoned Floptown municipality 15 times over ther course of the weekend.Three Sub contractors came one went to the shop across the road there two tried to fix it.Told me they are not allowed to cause the water meter is under warranty.The company that installed these devices must come ou***** Sunday late afternoon,still nothing.My honest opinion Bunch of incompetent lazy people that don't give a **** about how they work even if it's to deliver a service to the people.All they do is BULL**** you and saying they do understand,****ing ****ed up country!!!!!!!!}{How disgusting it is to be working the whole week, then when you get that off day in the week, you plan your day then go to the Phillipi Traffic Department.

Pre-Termination Notices

The law provides that a municipality must give the consumer (and the owner of the property, if the consumer of the services at the property is not the owner) a minimum of 14 days written notice of termination of the supply of electricity and water. If this notice is not given to the occupants of the property (and the owner, if the owner is not the same as the occupant) at all then the disconnection is illegal.

Furthermore, if less than 14 days has elapsed between the date of delivery of the pre-termination notice and the date of disconnection, then similarly the disconnection is illegal.

The purpose of giving a person 14 days is to allow that person to respond to the municipality within that time and to raise any disputes about the charges that are purportedly owing, or alternatively to allow the responsible person to make payment of the arrears or make other payment arrangements with the municipality such as by entering into an instalment payment plan. If a consumer is denied this opportunity, then this is a violation of that person’s rights in terms of our administrative law and Constitution and the disconnection is accordingly unlawful.}{My family and I have been without water for more than 4 days. Since they started working on the main pipes, the water has stopped. The City of Cape Town told me that they would arrive on the 03 September 2021 to replace the water meter.

Then just let me suggest this, that the DA will never get my vote again, along with everyone that is informed on hello peter and family members.

The water leak is become worse by the day. A sink hole is forming in the street. Water is leaking underground into our property. My paving was lifted and not replaced. Our water bill is very high and no one can tell is why. We are being sent  mails to say the problem was fixed. It seems that no one really cares that so much water is being wasted. It also seems that i am not living in the right area to have the leak fixed asap. We have been living in this house since 1992 and always paid our rates and water bill on time. Yet this is how we are treated by tge city. During the water shortage period they begges us to report any watee leaks asap. Now they just dont care. We are frustrates and need a response asap.

We have been without water since the 7th of August, in the prior days it was an on and off situation but we thought it was the case with all our neighbors but when I visited the strand municipality it turns out that was not the case. We have an issue with our water meter, it is completely blank. I have called and visited the municipal offices several times ,cases have been logged and escalated on the system but no one has come to fix the meter. 

This is a last resort to sort this issue out and as a result if its not fixed by tomorrow I will have no option but to connect it illegally because I have a new born baby and with the current Corona virus pandemic water is an essential need.

My contact number is **********}{As an electrical contractor, I sometimes need to apply for services on behalf of the client. Visiting the municipal offices you find everybody is "working from home". Approaching the available officials, is a nightmare. Very unhelpfull. speak to any member of the public, and they will tell you, it causes a knot in your tummy only to think about such a visit. No friendliness, no invitation to relay your problem, just a cold stare! In one incident I filed an application for power to be disconnected. The client completed the application document, but does not know his account or business partner number. Although there can only be one person with the same id number, address and meter number, I had to go back to the client. Then, back at the counter, the same very unhelpful "trainee" and her supervisor , gave me the cold stare, and this time requires the plot number. I , annoyed that I must go back again, requested that she must please help me, it is on the system. "Write the number down", came the order. "One seven seven....."
And then the wait. Puzzled expressions, as she was staring at the screen. Fumbling with the application papers. Scrutinizing them again. And I got worried, looking around, expecting a number of securities to rush in, arrest me. She must have found some dark secret about me in those papers. Or maybe she found out about my connections with the Russian Mafia. And then, surprisingly, with a look of desperation and disappointment, she slowly handed me the papers. In the meantime Mr Budha (her trainer) sat behind her. Motionless. In fact, Mr Budha is showing more compassion and friendliness than him. But unfortunately, it is not the end. Two days later I phoned the electrical department on the call centre number. Listen about all the services, the recording of the conversation for training purposes (bull****!), then a series of numbers to direct me to the relevant department. Then the waiting, some horrible, possibly Chinese music. And I wait. Ïf you dont want to hold on, please sent us a message via e-mail, and we will come back to you asap. Bull****! And I waited. "We are experiencing high volume calls, please hold on. Your call is important to us. Seventeen minutes and twenty seven sockets later, I was transferred, Sorry sir, we are experiencing....  BULL****! Then get more operators, I said. I wants to bet her for a thousand rand, if I phone at 12'0  çlock tonight, I will get the same message! She was not interested, or has no money!

Good day , your complaint has been reported , your reference number is ********** , kind regards *****ba for Electricity TOC, }{For a person that was never behind in my City of Cape Town bill I am frustrated with the City. The City overcharge me on my Electricity bill with 3x times as much. My bill of normally 3k change to 11k. The response was estimate was done wrong and they sent someone out to do actual reading but in my opinion the credit was not done properly. In March no bill was received call the call centre and agent promise to send the bill. But the bill was not sent and received one on the 24th. Now a person that was never behind on the bill is behind because of the City of Cape Town. This frustrates me.

Our water meter was stolen outside of my residence on the 30th of June, it was reported and nothing has been done since then,  it is now the 2nd of July and we still don't have running water. 

The lady I spoke to told me the city subcontracts with a company call zephron, I asked her if she has a contact detail for me and she tells me they don't have contact with them?????? Like what? How??? How do you do business with a company, and when it's no longer in your control you can't provide the customer with the relevant details so that you as the customer can contact them to find out what's going on. 

We are currently in our 3rd wave of covid-19 a time like this where we need to wash our hands and disinfect EVERYTHING, we have NO RUNNING WATER... 

City of Cape Town you need to do better.  I am appalled at the level of service you provide the people. It is disgusting how you take tax payers money, and give this poor level of service, the city definitely DOES NOT work for us, because if they did, I would have had running water 2 days ago.}{Hi there my granny died and left us with a water bill witch they said its free water the time my granny agreed to it and now the water bill is over R5000 behind we willing to make arrangements but the city dont want us to make payment arrangement anyone that can help with any info on how to go about please leave a message.}{December 2020 my uncle passed due to Covid. March 2021, my aunty went to traffic department to transfer my uncles cars onto her name. 
April 2021, she starts getting Fines to the OLD license plate for my uncles bakkie on her name. All the fines say the same charge reason, " Failed to display license disc in in windscreen" HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE IF:

1. The bakkie has not driven since December 2020 after my uncle died
2. my aunty is too short to drive the bakkie so it just stands in the garage
3. my aunty cannot drive without power steering.

I called the cities hot line, the told me to email *********** and was told it can take up to 10 weeks. 

NOW, While i wait for these incompetent people to sort this out, MORE FINES ARE ROLLING IN!!!!! And its Areas like Phillippi, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Mitchelsplain, R300.

My aunty has never been to those areas EVER in her entire life.

Now this to me looks like the dude who transferred the bakkie onto my aunties name either sold the plates to his friends or he messed up on the system when he done the transfer.
Either ways, the is Fraud happening here and while our police just rights up a fine for the criminals, they getting away with crimes. But if law abiding citizens dont display discs or modify our cars, then they come down on us like a ton of bricks

PATHETIC SERVICE FROM CITY OF CAPE TOWN !!!! And We voted these fools into power}{Slowest response time where government is concerned,been sitting without water for 4 days.
Reference no:**********}{My conventional water meter on the outside surface of my property was loose. I lodge a complaint for them to please come out and fix it in April 2021. A man came and took the loose cover of the old conventional water meter and advise someone will come out to erect the concrete and fix a cover again. To date no one has come out to actually fix it. I've logged several calls and request every time the agents advised it was escalated to the supervisor and to the regional manager but still no resolution.}{The CoCT removed our fully functioning water meter on Monday 21 June and replaced it with a new water meter. The reason given was that it was old. As soon as they replaced it we no longer have a water supply to our property. They never even checked if everything was working after the installation, they just left.  We logged a call with the Service Centre the same day to report the problem. We still have no water 4 days later. We are told WMD, whom the CoCT contracted to install the meter and have to come out but they cannot say when WMD will respond. WMD has yet to arrive to resolve the matter. There is absolutely no sense of urgency from the 
CoCT or WMD to resolve this matter.  Has anyone experienced the same issue where the water meter was replaced and you have no water after the installation? - municipal bill is up to date and water usage is within limit. }{4 days without water

Someone came today and they only confirmed the house number ,then left within 2 minutes and never came back.

After 2 weeks, frustrated by the Load shedding and I stay in a high crime area in Parow, I didn't feel safe in my own home..I contacted the Mayor's Office, via email.
 I explained my situation, The Street infront of my home is in total darkness, I am a woman home alone, that on two occasions thieves tried to break in my home.I am a woman home alone, most of the time and my home infront is in total darkness. My Car was broken in a few times. Loadshedding etc.
Still the Street light is broken.  
Why do we Vote? Why do we pay Rates and taxes, when the City of CapeTown in June 2021 can't repair something so basic as a Street Light.
 I contacted Everyone possible Even the Mayor's Office.. Almost a month now still the Street Light is Not Repaired. 
The City of CapeTown Cant Even Repair a Broken Street Light.... What about our Homes, Our vehicles being burglarized during Load Shedding..

When I check online, my request is marked as completed but no one has contacted me and my problem is not fixed still. I finally called today, and I am told the team came on Friday but couldn't fix the water leak at stop**** because it is a private property. This stop**** is situated in the pavement outside my yard. Nevertheless, I can understand any reason for not fixing the problem, but lack consultation or rather providing feedback was just uncalled for. While I sat patiently for 5 days without access to water, that is just undignified. I pay my rates and taxes religiously and this poor service is what I deserve. Its appalling really. The worse was when I called this morning, this guy asked me if I I switched off water pressure? Really now, was a supposed to leave the water gushing out for 5 days?

The security pointed me to teller 9. I went there and was redirected to the other tellers (Teller 17 – 19).
When I get to these tellers I saw teller no. 17 vacant and approached the lady there. Before she could even hear what I was saying she just shouted at me saying “hey hey go back to the queue and wait to be called”.
I then said to her please there’s no need to shout at me. She got up, left her desk and went to the back and continued shouting. I went back to the queue fuming, however I decided to wait and be served first then I asked for a manager. 

Government employees are very rude and have no respect for their job and their clients. There’s a lot of people looking for jobs who would do anything to have a job. This person doesn’t respect her clients and most importantly doesn’t respect her job.
I’m there to pay for a service which will in turn help her get paid at the end of day, so I don’t understand the fact that it seems as if I’m there begging for food from her.
}{I am so disgusted by the treatment i received from the City of Cape Town municipality , i was told that i am owing R77872.63 as loyal citizen i paid the money on the 26 February 2021.

I filled the necessary documentation & emailed it to the since today the money is not deposited in my account instead the are sending me from one pillar to another .

I gave them the proof of payment , confirmation letter from the bank, bank statement ,my ID, death certificate for my late husband, executor letter and the request form which was signed by my bank.

Good day. I am so frustrated with the sewage department at the City of Cape Town as the matter I am struggling with is going on for 2 months. The sewage pipe from the council causes a blockage and in return blocks our sewage system resulting in the toilets to be blocked. The council is not helpful at all. I have referred this to the Ombudsman as well. I had countless communications to the council that remain unanswered even with senior management. I have records of all communications and people involved. I have warned them that I will go to social media and yet I had not had any response. My wife struggles with her chest due to the sewage smell and the toilets gets blocked consistently. I also have photos. Should the council not react immediately I will sue them for the health issues of my family and will also go on Facebook with photos. I have a wife and 3 small children and the response from the council is shocking. I will escalate this matter rapidly if necessary
}{I live in Asanda Village, Strand. I have a problem of the water coming from one of the burst pipe next to my yard. My whole yard is full of water. My neighbors also have this oroblem. I went to report the matter to the municipality in Somerset on the 7th of April 2021 and also sent several smes. They came on the 15th. They dug a whole next to my gate and used the machinery to drain the water from that hole. The next thing they left without fixing anything and the situation is getting worse. There is water allover in my yard. They also dug out my water meter and left it uncovered. Can someone help me. }{What I would like to know is why I should contain mt house refuse in plastic bags before putting it into the refuse bin. Also, I am spending money monthly to sanitize and keep my bin clean. The Municipality is allowing vagrants to indiscriminately tear open the refuse bags and litter. The refuse trucks are mainly late by sometimes a day or two leaving the residents to daily pick up refuse. As the refuse trucks officials do not pick up what has been emptied on the ground we paying residents are left with this mess. This during the pandemic is becoming a health issue as the vagrants rarely wear masks and maggots, brommers and worms are breeding.}{I received an sms, that I have an outstanding speeding fine in Cape Town.

Spoke to two customer service representatives yesterday by far the rudest and most ill mannered agents I have ever had the dismay of talking to. 
Please heed this as a formal complaint because not only was the representative unhelpful  but their lack of customer service skills (empathy) and general attitude towards this query was completely uncalled for. 
We still do not have any electricity and our consumables are slowly rotting away. 
Please attend to this matter immediately I doubt the representative even gave me her real name. }{The advice is promoted: "If you experience problems with the municipality and have a complaint, then contact the City's Ombudsman". So I did. Complaining that the City ignores my complaints and emails. Now what! Even the Ombudsman ignores me. Two weeks after the due date of 120 days to revert back and a reminder, not even a cricket in the background! }{I first reported a CoCT water meter leak on 15.01.21 (having noticed an unpredicted increase in the water consumption on the invoice received the day before. I went out and checked at the meter out on the street). Since then I have 16 various reference numbers reporting the same fault. After many calls and emails, even copying in my local ward councillor, I received an email from CoCT on 30.03.2021 explaining that my water meter does indeed need to be replaced  but they do not have any meters in stock and are unable to give me any indication of when they will have stock or when my meter will be replaced. 
Having received my 4th consecutive inflated CoCT invoice, I called the CoCT accounts department 19.04.2021 who lodged a request for an interim measure (I believe its called a "straight line") to be put in place in the meantime. It was explained that this is a measure that can be put in place until such time as their new meters arrive. I am gobsmacked that no one at CoCT has thought to implement this interim measure yet, after me having made so much contact about the meter leak problem (and 3x CoCT teams who have arrived, looked and left). 

I was also informed by the CoCT accounts department that I have to continue to pay the inflated invoices until the matter is resolved - currently my water consumption is almost 800% more than my 21 year average in this property. Resolution will only be once CoCT has secured the needed water meter and has done the job of installing it. Both of which I have no power over. I was advised that I will need to go to the nearest CoCT walk-in centre with 3 months bank statements and prove that I cannot afford to pay the current consumption - if I am unwilling to pay more than I would normally. It is not my meter, it's not my water consumption, both are CoCTs!!

Any others with a similar experience, any solutions?

Nobody spoke to me, we just saw it was open by our meter. 

When I phone it doesn't even ring and the whatsapp number for water and sanitation isn't even on WhatsApp so I have run out of options. This is just ridiculous now because I digged a hole by the pipe and covered it with tape which helped slow down the water coming out.

Please help us. }{The City of Cape Town claims that my electricity account is in arrears – a matter which I have attempted to resolve for well over a year. I have been misled and lied to and have exhausted every avenue searching for explanations.
In November 2019 I received a billing of just over R 13 000-00 from the Municipality – an amount which has somehow escalated to R 17 000-00 since then. Numerous visits to both Plumstead and Fish Hoek Municipal offices to resolve this problem only confirmed the incompetence and lack of will by the various officials, to resolve my concerns. 
I was informed by a Plumstead Consultant that it was on record that my meter readings could not be taken, as there was no access to my property and it was for this reason that all readings over the past months were Estimates. The fact that this was on record confirms the extent of the deceit and lies the Municipality will go to in order to validate their actions. My property has no entrance gate, nor a driveway gate and only a knee high wall on its boundary. The electricity meter box can be clearly seen mounted on the wall of my house and there are no obstacles in the way to access it. I produced photos of the access and am still unable to get an answer as to why this lie was noted on their computer. The only response I received, was that I could arrange a payment to settle the amount they claimed I owe.
I asked to speak to a senior Consultant and was then attended to by MS BIANCA MORKEL – she took all my particulars – dated and signed acknowledgement on my rates bill and promised to address my complaint “WITH A HOLLISTIC APPROACH”.  She promised to get back to me within a couple of weeks. 
MORE THAN 15 MONTHS HAVE PASSED BY AND BIANCA MORKEL HAS STILL NOT RESPONDED.
On 04 December 2019 I again visited the Plumstead Municipal Office and discussed my concerns with MS EDWARD – she was unable to explain the false report on their system regarding access to my property, but she did advise me to continue paying my rates and promised to follow up on my electricity issue.
On 18 December 2019 I received a telephone call from MR RODRIGUES, who advised that he was to investigate my claim of a faulty meter. He asked me to turn all power off at the electricity meter box and check if the wheel was still turning. I did what he asked and took a video of the wheel as it continued to turn – I sent it to him and he acknowledged that there must be a problem with the meter. He then asked me to take a picture of the actual meter reading and forward it to him.  
On 01 January 2020 I received another call from MR RODRIGUES asking me to take another photo of the meter reading and forward it to him. On 11 January 2020 he again contacted me to take another photo of the meter which I forwarded to him and on 13 January 2020 I received a Whatsapp message from MR RODRIGUES asking me to stop sending photos. He acknowledged that there was a problem, as my average ACTUAL readings were constant at a daily usage of 19 kWh and noted that it was strange that there were such variations when ESTIMATES were done.
On 03 March I returned to the Municipality to query the huge variations in the ESTIMATES – the consultant was obnoxious and rude and repeatedly told me to go and pay my bill. She said “there was nothing wrong with my meter and her computer was not wrong”. 
On 31 August 2020 I received mail from MR EDWIN THOMAS that the Municipality was going to remove my existing meter and replace it with a prepaid meter. This in itself seemed strange, considering that for years I had been trying to get them to install a prepaid meter, but it was refused.
On 30 October 2020 I received mail from IC BUSINESS ADMINISTRATORS threatening to instruct the Sheriff to serve Court papers on me. I contacted the call centre number and requested to speak to one of the Directors – none were available and I asked them to place on record that I wanted them to speed up the process, so that I could finally approach the Court to seek relief. 
I RECEIVED NO FURTHER RESPONSE AND COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT THE MUNICIPALITY IS FEARFUL OF ANY LEGAL ACTION EXPOSING THEIR FAILURES TO PROPERLY SERVE THE PUBLIC.
On 04 November 2020 a Technician attended my property and explained the benefits of the prepaid meter and told me that once the meter had been installed, I would be able to keep complete control of my consumption. I advised him that I was only prepared to have the meter installed once the ridiculous billing had been resolved. He promised that once the meter was in place, I would be starting afresh and the billing would revert back to a zero balance. 
On 24 November 2020 I received mail from MR TREVOR BLAKE – DIRECTOR OF REVENUE. He accused me of failing to apply for any of the City benefits and threatened to deduct a percentage of any electricity I purchased, to offset against arrears he claimed I owed. He completely ignored the many meetings I had at the Municipal offices and the false promises to properly investigate my concerns. 
THE INSTALLATION OF THE PREPAID METER WAS CLEARLY A FRAUDULENTLY PLANNED SCHEME TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ME.
On 18 December 2020 I received mail from MR KHANZI of CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPARTMENT requesting my Municipal account number for assistance.
OVER A YEAR HAD PASSED BY AND NOW THE DEPARTMENT ASKS WHICH PROPERTY THEY ARE DEALING WITH.
I am a Pensioner and together with my wife’s Pension, we receive a monthly amount of R3 720-00. The Municipality is aware of this, yet refuse to properly address my complaint. I purchase a weekly recharge amount of R 300-00 and this gives us 141.90kWh – an amount which lasts for 8 days.
On 08 January 2020 I purchased R 300-00 of electricity and found that I had been given only 41 units. THE MUNICIPALITY SEES FIT TO DEDUCT R 213-00 FROM EVERY R 300-00 PURCHASE – THIS IS 71 PERCENT OF MY PAYMENT. 
On 19 January 2021 I was able to attend a meeting with COUNCILLOR PATRICIA FRANCKE OF THE DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE who was quite helpful in directing my complaint to the relevant Department. Initially I received a response from MS MICHELLE GERALDINE ANDREWS – ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER IN THE REVENUE OFFICE. 
As expected, the response began with a plea to accept her sincere apologies for the way in which my request had been dealt – followed by various other issues I have attempted to resolve over the years, but which the Department has failed to resolve. I was NOT addressing these issues in my complaint, but that of the electricity theft. I responded with a stern letter, to which I have still received no response.
On 26 January 2021 I received mail from MS NICOLE LATEGAN - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER IN REVENUE MANAGEMENT ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION. The mail I received was not only contradictory to previous mail, but more focussed on the usual insincere apologies and excuses to cover the failures of other colleagues in the Department.
The investigation by MS NICOLE LATEGAN revealed the following:
 1. Your account was ESTIMATED during April and June 2020 due to the National Lockdown – the City could not perform meter readings as it was not deemed an ESSENTIAL SERVICE. 
ONE WOULD EXPECT THE RECOVERY OF MONEY TO BE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO MAINTAIN SERVICE DELIVERY – VERY LITTLE OF WHICH WE SEE THESE DAYS.
 2. Your account was underestimated during this period and thus when an ACTUAL reading was obtained, your account was higher than usual.
ACCORDING TO THE MUNICIPAL RECORDS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCESS MY PROPERTY - HOW DID THE DEPARTMENT OBTAIN ACTUAL READINGS. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A BILLING WHERE THE ESTIMATE IS LESS THAN THE ACTUAL READING – IN EVERY CASE IT HAS BEEN DOUBLE OR MORE.
 3. A comparison between the average consumption billed on the previous meter and your electricity purchases on the prepaid meter has revealed your consumption in line and consistent on both meters. This indicates that it is very unlikely that the previous meter was faulty.
A SECOND LETTER FROM MS NICOLE LATEGAN CLEARLY STATED THAT A METER CAN ONLY BE DECLARED FAULTY AFTER A CALLIBRATION TEST HAS BEEN PERFORMED. THE TEST WOULD ONLY BE DONE VIA APPLICATION AND PAYMENT BY THE CUSTOMER – THIS WAS NEVER DONE, YET SHE CONCLUDES THAT THE PREVIOUS METER WAS NOT FAULTY.
 4. A Technician visited your property in March 2020 and confirmed that the meter did stop turning when the power was turned off. The Technician stated on his job card that he advised you that you may apply for the meter to be tested – to date the City had not received an application for a meter test.                                                                                                                                                          CONTRADICTION: Upon removal of the old meter and its arrival at the City Lab, the Technician who inspected the meter had also not found a fault with it.
APART FROM THE RECORDS SHOWING THAT MY PROPERTY COULD NOT BE ACCESSED, IT IS A TOTAL FABRICATION THAT A TECHNICIAN VISITED MY PROPERTY – I WAS ALSO NOT CONFRONTED BY ANYONE, NOR ADVISED TO APPLY FOR A METER CALLIBRATION TEST. 
 5. When I referred to the consumption on the old meter and the new meter being consistent, I was referring to the consumption and not the Rand value. Your daily average on the new meter, as well as on the old meter during the summer period is 19kWh.
I AM A PENSIONER AND HAVE TO BUDGET – HENCE I CALCULATE EVERYTHING IN RANDS. I FAIL TO SEE THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS COMMENT, AS REGARDLESS OF KwH or Rands – the one equates to the other. THE FACT THAT BOTH METERS WERE CONSISTENT AT AVERAGE 19kWh MUST SURELY SHOW THE INACURACIES OF THE ESTIMATION – IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MY WIFE AND I TO USE R 16 000 OF ELECTRICITY IN THREE MONTHS, UNLESS THE MUNICIPALITY CONTINUES EXTORTING 71 PERCENT FROM MY PAYMENTS.
 6. The City’s stance remains unchanged and that your account is correct. Should you be dissatisfied by the above findings, you are welcome to raise your concerns with the City Ombudsman.
SUCH ARROGANCE IS DEPLORABLE – MS NICOLE LATEGAN IS FULLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT TAKES A MINIMUM OF THREE MONTHS FOR THE OMBUDSMAN TO ADDRESS A COMPLAINT AND IN THIS TIME SHE WILL HAVE CRIPPLED ME FINANCIALLY. I DID APPROACH THE CITY OMBUDSMAN ON 09 JANUARY 2021 AND STILL AWAIT A RESPONSE.

IN PREVIOUS MAIL TO BOTH MS GERALDINE ANDREWS AND MS NICOLE LATEGAN, I DEMANDED ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING:
1. THE MUNICIPAL BY LAWS ARE VERY CLEAR IN THAT ELECTRICITY MAY NOT BE CUT WHILST A COMPLAINT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION – WHY HAVE THEY IGNORED THIS BY LAW?
2.  WHAT GIVES THE MUNICIPALITY THE RIGHT TO VIOLATE MY MUNICIPAL AND CONSTUTIONAL RIGHTS AS A TAX PAYING CITIZEN AND PENSIONER AND DEPRIVE ME OF THE SERVICES TO WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT?
3. WHAT GIVES THE MUNICIPALITY THE RIGHT TO DICTATE WHAT PERCENTAGE THEY CAN DEDUCT FROM MY PAYMENTS TOWARD A SERVICE WITH NO REGARD TOWARD THE DAMAGE IT MAY CAUSE – THIS IS FRAUDULENT AND ILLEGAL?
4. WHY HAS THE DEPARTMENT NOT CLARIFIED WHY THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF A FAULT BY MR RODRIGUES HAS BEEN IGNORED – YET WITHOUT ANY PROPER TESTING OF THE METER MS LATEGAN STATES THAT THEIR ACTIONS ARE CORRECT?
5. WHY WHEN I APPROACHED THE MUNICIPALITY WAS I TOLD THAT YOUR FIELD STAFF WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS MY PROPERTY AND THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO MY METER BOX – WHEN I PRODUCED PHOTOS OF MY ELECTRIC BOX AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD, AS WELL AS PHOTOS TAKEN OF MY PROPERTY ENTRANCE FROM NEXT TO THE METER BOX WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS NO GATE AND FREE ACCESS AND THEY WERE SHOWN TO MS EDWARD – SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE EASY ACCESS?
6. WHY HAS IT TAKEN MORE THAN A YEAR TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM MS MORKEL AND I AM STILL WAITING – YET YOU SEE FIT TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR HER LACK OF RESPONSE?
7. WHY WAS IT NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL METER IF – AS YOU CLAIM – THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT?
This has been an ongoing issue for over a year with the complaint being passed from one Department to the next. I have been misinformed and lied to over this time, with no explanation. The Municipality feels that they have Carte Blanche to dictate to the Public and feel that they can juggle Public funds around to suit themselves. The issue of ESTIMATES is nothing more than an excuse for the Municipality to overcharge on Public accounts – probably to pull in extra monies to bulk up their coffers. It is unacceptable and abusive that the Municipality sees fit to abuse personal savings of the Public – more so, the savings of the elderly and low income groups, with little regard toward their personal situations. }{Valuations - I have emailed the City Valuations department on 5 occassions with a request that they send me Valuation Objection Forms. 
No acknowledgement of receipt of email. Used the email address provided on their valuations form.
According to the Valuations department, the Objections department does not have a contact telephone number.
Objections must be in by 31st March. They also state that no late objections will be accepted.}{I dont know if i am using the right playform to lay a complain against city of cape town municipality. I have tried every avenue but to no success. My husband i moved into our house in 2017 and has been complaining about our water meter that has been faulty. Its 2021 already and still nothing. We have been to every office of city of cape town. All we get is reference numbers claiming the busy investigating. Our water has been estimated ever since we moved into our property and when we laid a complain , we were told just to pay the minimum amount seeing that is not our right water reading. We were told that the account would be placed on hold and would not accrue any further till the matter has been resolved. In the year 2019 my husband received a letter from head office stating that the needs to make arrangement on payment or they will deduct everything from his bonus as he is a city of cape town employee. We went to head office to try to make arrangement, but the staff was rude and illiterate they couldnt even assist us. Bear in mind no arrangement has been made that money can be deducted from his salary and then november came when the city receives their bonuses and they deducted 50% of his bonus. Ever since that they are deducting money of his account every month. Yet nothing has been done about the faulty water meter. City of cape town is the worst on service delivery to our law abiding rates and tax payers. However informal settlements gets unlimited water free of charge. I am disgusted by the service i received from you guys. I would like to know what i can do to get assistance from the city of cape municipality to fix my broken water meter.}{Had applied and paid for vehicle license online and six "6" months later still waiting for my disc!!}{WE ARE HIGHLY UPSET,DISPOINTED NO WORDS OF OUR FRUSTRATING

}{I phoned the City of Cape Town Electricity Dept. on Friday 12 February 2021 at approx. 13:45, and spoke to a lady who said her name was Samantha. She said that she logged the call and gave me a reference number **********).
Today, Tuesday 16 February 2021 I phoned their call centre again to get an update on the issue, and was advised that although the reference number did exist, it had not been logged with the relevant department. 
Thank you for nothing Samantha!}{There was an awful stench coming from a communal sewerage drain located on my property. I called the helpline; it was answered pretty quickly and within 2mins a ref no was sent to me. Half an hour later a van from the incorrect dept arrived. The mistake was rectified and half an hour later the correct crew arrived. The problem was identified as roots growing into the pipe; the blockage was cleared within 10mins. Job well done!!}{Bad service. No willingness to assist - they actually look for reasons noto to help instead of going the extra mile at Mitchells Plain Promenade offices - they close e.g. 12h30 bt stop allowing clients into the premises way before that so that they can leave by 12h30 instead of allowing clients access until 12h30. Staff turn away clients for the most simple reasons and get annoyed and rude to your face when you ask for management or challenge them. Wish that the municipality could employ better staff that are more skilled, has more knowledge and empathy }{I would like to know what does one have to do in order to be assisted by City of Cape Town regarding a water issue.

It have been almost two weeks without water and I have called City numerous times I even lost count, and it seems this issue will never be resolved.

Does City look at who you are, what do you have and where you stay in order to attend to someone’s issue/problem?

I seriously don’t know what else to do or who to call in order to be assisted.


}{An application was submitted for the installation of a 100mm fire hose connection in September 2020 and a huge deposit was paid.  Despite numerous phone calls and the request being escalated, nothing has been done up until today 9th February 2021.  Contact numbers have been given to me but not once has it been answered. Visits to the City on the Fores**** has proved fruitless.  Emails to the City Manager comes back as undelivered.  It is such a shocking situation as I am unable to contact anyone in management who can speed up the process}{Despite having paid all penalties and fees, which has been acknowledged by the licensing department. They refuse to issue my discs for a s****** as well as a caravan paid for last year. visits to the traffic dept. as well as correspondence to the City of Cape Town which includes a letter to my ward councilor and the ombudsman. have failed to yield a result.
This means that despite having done everything that has been asked of me I am at risk of being fined due to not having the license discs on both these vehicles. 
To add to this they now refuse to issue a licence for my car.
I cannot contact anyone because the 086 number does not work unless you heve unlimited airtime as well as a couple of days to sit on the phone in the hope of somebody deciding to actually answer your call
THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF INCOMPETENCE AND I WOULD LOVE FOR SOMEBODY TO TELL ME WHAT ELSE I CAN DO OTHER THAN TO ENGAGE THE SERVICES OF A LAWYER
}{I sold my property, transfer took place November 2020. Transferring attorneys paid over more to get the Rates Clearance Certificate. R9900 to be exact. Then they send me my final bill Dec, fabrication an Electricity amount for the month, to the vlue of R7000+, to just get out of refinding me. I requested an immediate reversal, based on actual readings. Finally got the Correct Final Account, now I must BEG for a refund. This City is quick to ask for money, and cut your water, but when they owe you, its first this stort, then that story. I am beyond frustrated!!}{In November I arranged with the City of Cape Town to pay the monies towards the Rates Account I owe them.
After not receiving an account for the December and no response from their people requesting an account, I was capped on my Electricity meter.  Note, despite not receiving an account, I still paid.  Despite receiving no reference number for my email account change I still paid.  Despite receiving 3 different amounts that I owed, I still paid.
January I still paid and requested why the meter was capped.  I received a threatening email from the Rates department head or what ever he wants to call himself.  He then advised me I need to go to the Call Centre, Walk in Centre.  This was to delay the process coming back to their department again.  I then contacted the Director, who only after a week replied to my email via his Admin.  
I now am capped 66%.  I must now pay R2100 extra to have electricity supposed to the R900 which amounts to R3000 per month just to keep the meter going due to this ridiculous cap.  This is excluding my bill which I out of good faith and eager to pay it off wanted to raise R500 in stead of the first arrangement of R200.
Furthermore, the Municipality, same people, tells me that I owe monies, based on my so-called Business Partner number, outstanding of 15 years ago on a property I owned, and they calculated my rates incorrectly.  My cell number has not changed in 25 years.  My ID has not changed and my current address where I have been living for the last year and a half, they have not been able to advise me of this?  Now suddenly.  
Worst is the City Manager can not even contact you or you him due to his full mailbox.
Little bit of trivia.  They did not tell that their actual Business Partner numbers was actually mis captured by people they asked to capture it replacing the business partner number with the first 6 digits of the ID number.  That they conveniently forgot.  How do I know this?  A ex SAP colleague who worked there and recently retired was more than happy to share this information with me upon hearing my story.
Furthermore, the people who are working in Debt collection do not have any financial qualification, yet they have the right to decide what you can afford.  They, without your knowledge, draw reports on ITC also requests bank statements that is against the POPIA act obtaining your personal information.  This is all done without your consent.  They are not a financial institution and persists over no FSP number.  
Really, be aware as there is only one of these departments in the City of Cape Town and the public needs to know who they are.}{Can someone please explain the drop in the amount of units when buying electricity 3 times in a space of a week ?
For R200 on the 24 Jan 2021 I was getting 83.4 units kWh
For R200 on the 28 Jan 2021 I was getting 71.4 units kWh and today 31 Jan 2021 I am getting 68.6 units kWh for R200.}{My refuse removal day is Tuesday, it is now Friday and it has still not been emptied. My bin is now a health hazard and full of maggots.
A friend of mine lives in Southway (by the golf course) and his bin day was Thursday and his bin was emptied one day later!!! how come??  Our whole area (Pinelands, by the top train station, Sunset Crescent) is full of bin refuse. THIS IS A HEALTH HAZARD ENCOURAGING MAGGOTS, RATS AND OTHER VERMIN. I am still expected to pay my refuse account at the end of each month. I have reported it and my reference number is **********.}{City of Cape Town water department is really messing me around.
On Sunday 24 January 2021 I reported a water leak on reference number **********.
The next morning a sub-contractor was out and replaced my old water meter with new meter that limits the amount of water a client gets per day.
It was as if all they were out to do was replace the meter and not really check where the leak is.
This never resolved the leak and I reported it again on Tuesday 26 January 2021 with reference number **********.
3 days later the city has still not been out.
They say the connection from the meter into my property is my responsibility, but I say they city requested to move my meter outside of my property so they could have easier access to it, so they laid that pipe and it should remain their responsibility.
Because originally the meter was right next to my stop cork and I should not have let them move it as all my neighbours' done by refusing.
On Wednesday 27 January 2021 I called the council office again on ********** at 07h30 and spoke to an agent who was very dismissive.
The same day I called again at 13h17 and spoke to very helpful male agent, Ashwin, for 37 minutes.
He listened to my scenario and was very empathetic, good service, he spoke to 2 of his supervisors, while I was on the call with him, and they also advised that the meter was moved out of the property, the stop cork was the original one belonging to the council and never replaced, so that leg from the meter to the stop cork was still the responsibility of the council.
He said he made notes on reference number ********** to this effect.
On Thursday 28 January 2021 I called in again at 07h30 and the agent told me they will be out today to resolve the issue. 

The slogan is "The City that works for you" is definitely not true.}{After having paid my license disc on e-service before Aug 2020 (exp date),  and repeatedly calling to check the progress thereof, was told on 29th of December that it had been posted on 24th of December. Now more than a month later, not having received it via post yet, I was told by a  agent to physically come to Civic centre for a reprint. Waiting in a quee for almost 4 hours. Poor service. }{I am the registered owner of a property in Fishoek, but I live overseas. There is a tenant on the property, and I pay the rates. For the past 8 years I have paid my rates account with my overseas visa card via paycity.co.za. For unknown reasons, PayCity no longer accept payments on behalf of the Capetown City Council.  I emailed the council on the 27th of December and as seems to be the norm had an automated response to the effect that they would get back to me in 7 days. I then decided to call the council on the number listed on their website, and I got an email back from them with their bank account details. Payment in the amount of R2800 was made to them by international bank transfer on the 30th of December 2020, and I received a proof of payment by my forex service provider on the 31st December. Proof of payment was sent by email to the council. I checked my account a week later and noticed that the R2800 that I paid had not been credited to my account. I emailed again, and still got the usual automated response and nothing else. In addition to emails. I have made at-least 5 phone calls and all I get is an undertaking that the query has been referred to the department concerned and I will hear back form them shortly, which of course I never do. In the mean time, my tenant is having part of her electricity payments deducted to pay of this alleged outstanding amount. She is a person of limited means, and she pays me a nominal rental. The downright incompetence of this institution is mind boggling. They neither act on queries nor do they reply to emails. In the meantime they have now charged me another month's rates and are threatening legal action for recovery of so called overdue amounts. I do not wish to pay them for this month as I am sure they will miss allocate my payment again. Yet they do nothing!.
What am I supposed to do? Is there any person or institution that can take this up on my behalf? If I could get on a plane and visit them personally I would do so but due to covid this is impossible }{Currently 2 days of no POWER and still no one has time to come and switch on the circuit breaker on my power pole.... phoned and reported it, phoned like 7 times during the 2 days to follow up, and the last phone call they said that they stop working at 7pm. ***!!!! this is rubbish's, understaffed or catching up on back lock. management is down the drain.}{I live in Plumstead on Churchill Road.

We have seen two speed bumps placed at the top of Churchill Road but when I ask for speed bumps for the lower side of Churchill Road before the circle I get rude emails with literally every possible excuse in the book. We have a junior school and high school roughly 100m from our house, children walking home, people running or walking their dogs. We have had a car hit he curb and tree due to excessive speeding to flip itself onto its roof and another car with a drunk driver crash into our driveway. Yet nothing is ever done to stop or resolve these matters! I had a police officer agree to put up a speed detector and I spoke to him snd he said he agreed with what I have complained about and asked to have done yet I get excuses! I have suggested more speed bumps, a fixed camera box, pedestrian crossings but cars wouldn’t stop anyway! What needs to happen for these issues to be resolved and addressed, a child, person or animal needs to be killed by a speeding car, all because I’m told that Churchill Road is wide enough for all these offenses to go unaddressed!

}{We pay the city of Cape Town a rediculous amount of money each and every month to collect our rubish on a Monday. During the last year this has just about Never happened. They always collect either on a Teusday or lately on a Wednesday. In the interim every homeless person that can get to the area comes around and scratches in the bins to the extend that you have to spend hours cleaning up after them. Now if you ask them to stop collecting from your house as there is a rubish dump run by the Council within 1 km from your house and you can take your rubbish there yourself you are informed that thisis not possible. It seems that the drivers of these rubish collecting vechiles cannot read and would therefore not be able to see from which houses they should orshould not collect.  One wonders how without being able to read they obtained drivers licences for heavy vechiles. Should you not pay the City and use pre-paid electricity they will take the monies owedfor the undelivered servicesoff before giving you electricity. Even when you offer to lighten their burden by removing your own rubish they do not want your assistance. All they want is your money. But your president goes on national TV and asks the citizens to help them. Why should we when they fail in theirmost basic jobs so badly. The City of Cape Town is going to the dogs and offering to help people like that is not even appreciated. As long as they can take your money they are happy.}{I have a faulty meter since September 2020 I reported the matter and I was told that I might have a leakage somewhere in my house, I called a plumber but i'm still experiencing the same problem, now I do not have water since Friday the 18th Dec I called so many times, sent emails and inbox they said within 48 hours,

Right now we have raw sewage running down our road because the residents of that township throw their nughtsoil into our road. There is no waste plan in that township. So all the garbage from them, is deposited into our suburb along with the effluent. We have met with Dan Plato the Mayor, Robeeto Quintas, our ward councillor, Matthew Kempthorne, Malusi Booi and many others. A fence was supposed to be erected between ourselves and this township but they have left ipenings for gates. So essentially it's not a fence. It's an abysmal municipality and I would certainly not choose to live in Cape Town because of their gross incompetence but have no chouce but to stay here as they've driven the value of my property down below zero as nobody in their right mind would live in this slum created by dysfunctional City of Cape Town.}{I am a resident in Danarand and I do have an exorbitant utility bill form City of Cape Town which has a result from a leak in 2017. I had to make arrangement upon arrangement for the last 3 years making it a frustrated, tedious and just plain depressing. These people are extortionists that is looking for soft targets and using intimidation to keep us at ransom. I received an sms during lockdown that my arrangement was cancelled and that I must phone them. I phoned them on 3 Sept and 25 Nov and the official Nazo helping  me advised me that I request a cancellation of the amount. She advised me to visit the Cape Town offices. I went to the Cape Town offices and was rudely awaken by the official Roxy who said that I was liable for the R200 00 utility bill as they already given me a rebate. I had leaks on my property and I installed a Water Management Device. I had to agree to install this device to apply for a rebate. Between the application for the WMD and its installation the account skyrocketed from R 6 000 to R 400 000. The installation came with its outages for weeks on end. I was bullied and intimidated by Lindeka Dubase today to pay R 12 000 or I will be disconnected. I do not know what to do. Please help.}{I stood in a 2hour Q, only to be told at the counter that the car I made an online payment for is not showing on the system, which means I can't get licence for my other cars. A problem that is not mine, anyway I was told to get proof of payment which I did, went back to the licence department only to be told to stand in that 2hour + Q again..... Really.. }{Been slapped with a 7-fold electricity estimate. Trying to call accounts through the call center does not work. Email has a multiple day turnaround.

This once was a well run city. }{It's now almost 3 months that I reported street lights that off in Connaught road uitsig ... It's the city of Cape town's job to fix it with more than 20 reference number of surrounding residents (4 of my own)... Still no response. It's pitch black at night you can't see a thing outside, while living in a high crime area we as residents find it hard to sleep peacefully at night drug addict and gangsters are taking advantage of this situation and it's getting worse... Break-in at night people getting rob on there way to work or from work shooting at night, This never happened before, not to talk about old people living in fear for their lives because they living alone, Theres people roaming around at night is heartless, must someone first lose a life before the situation getting attention I'm so disappointed in the service we get, The ward council is well aware of this situation but still no feedback whatsoever...
The city of Cape town thinks nothing about our people and their safety I'm really disgust an furious regarding this situation..

}{To the Mayor's office. 
I am sick to death of the disgusting service I have received while trying to renew my vehicle car license since MARCH OF THIS YEAR. I cannot deal with any more incompetence.
I have written to you, at the mayors office and once again, have heard NOTHING.
This is totally unacceptable and a pathetic service. Care to tell me when somebody is going to deal with my matter?  I can't even get a response from you, Mr. Plato. What now? 
Lesley Manford}{Best combination of stores, Clothing, music, sport, hardware(builders opening soon),gaming, book shop, jewelers, food. The inside revamp is great. May I add though that the bathrooms are often out of soap though}{To the offcials responsible for Ward 19. your service is utterly disgusting.

 have logged a request to cut grossly overgrown shrubs on public land. it has been five months still nothing has been cut. Mr Phumelele Kwayinani() falsely stated the erf belongs to a private company and that they are not responsible. no evidence of this were provided. after me visiting the deeds office, and provding supporting evidence, they confirmed the land belongs to city of cape town. 

however still nothing is done... i wonder who they will blame next. Ther lack of responsibility from senior officials and ward councillor is appaling. the laziness shown by Mr. Phumelele are evident throughout the ramks of City of Cape town.

how long does it take to cut overgrown vegetation.}{They were as good as their word. My power is now back on, fully repaired.}{More than 3 years to try and sort out my account & you'll get a better response from a ****roach! ****ing useless idiots! Now they've started STEALING money from my tenant's prepaid electricity account for what they say is an outstanding debt which came about as an ERROR on their side!!!!! They even have a name for this; it is called ***GY BACKING!!! Quite fitting for the the ***S who came up with this! 70% of prepaid gets deducted from my tenant every time a purchase is made. UN ****ING BELIEVABLE!!!! No wander people HATE this ****ing country and want to leave!}{And the ****ty service continues. I went to Kuils river local municipality on Thursday 5/1120  to give them the motivational letter they waiting on. An African girl helped me and i was still so chuffed with her only to find out that the letter was never send to the department concerned and here I wait. Like a blerrie donky because i did what was expected of me to do but they did not do there part. And they are never wrong according to them because if you go there then they harre gat like you did something wrong. No man Kuils river municipality must catch a wake up because they are pathetic. I dont know who is in charge there but that person must be fired.... Very... Very bad service from them..... Joh..... No man.... }{CITY OF CAPE TOWN YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED:
Yesterday the pipe from my water meter came loose and started flooding the road. I got it right to get the pipe tied up so water is not waisted as we just come out of a draught. IT IS THE CITY OF CAPE TOWN'S JOB TO COME OUT AND FIX THEIR PIPE SO I CAN HAVE WATER TO MY PROPERTY. It has been more than 24 hours and no water to my house. My family has not washed or my toilets flushed, I pay my rates and taxes every month and this is how we get treated in our own country, if this has happened to me howmany other people out their just has to sit back and watch the bad service delivery? 
City of Cape Town you are doing a horrible job, you think you the best province in the country but you just as bad as the other provinces. We live in a country where our people just get milked for their money but nobody cares for the people.
Please share this so that the City of Cape Town can see what a poor service they give to the people that pays their salaries.
}{I to like to complain about the INCOMPETENCY! of the City of Cape Town licensing department and their system. I applied for my vehicle license online over a month and a half ago. I am to date still waiting on the license. I went today to the license department to license my other vehicles that are expiring end of November, After standing in the queue from 5:30am to be told at 9:30am that I cannot license my other vehicles because I have an expired license on my name that I paid for online but which the city has not processed all my vehicles cannot be licensed. So I will soon be driving around with an unlicensed vehicle because of the city and may be fined by the city because my license is expired. I feel like screaming because all they say is there is nothing they can do I just have to wait for the process, WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! }{Last night, 3/11/2020 my power went off at 10.30pm. I called the City. 20 minutes later their techs arrived and told me that they had established that the exterior cable had been damaged. They were of the opinion that the recent fibre cable fitters had damaged cable. I was told another team would come today and fix it.

They were as good as their word. My power is now back on, fully repaired.
Thank you City of Cape Town. 

GREAT SERVICE

Like all the other inefficient business, it is talk and promises and nothing materialize.
We have been without water now for a day - and nobody seems to be worried about it - no offer of assistance (other areas get water tanks delivered) - we have to struggle along with very little resources and buy water in this very tough economic times.
5 calls and 5 references later and still no water. It would appear that this City really does not work for me.
No feedback - promises only - and no promise realized. I am sick of the whole system and really hope the current party gets a massive jerk in the mouth next year. 
A complain lodged on 16 October - confirmation receipt received - states 7 working days - note working days. 12 working days later and I am not holding my breath that we will get some reaction or response. I do foresee this winding up in court - again!
I have never had the privilege of dealing with so much ineptitude.
The local municipality where all the items originate from is even worse - a complain lodged 3 years ago where shuffled from one to the next, to the next - almost like musical chairs.
I do not care who stands next year in our area, I will vote for them and not the current ruling party.
}{So my vehicle was stolen in Nov 2016 from Wynberg Maynard Mall area,and no communication from any authority since.

you can not ask people to do something online then nothing happen and eventually fine a person.}{DA AND CPT CITY SUCKS. 
my water has been off since friday,  and guess what MY BILLS IS PAID. 
you are quick to put off water due to non payment but when the error occurs on the citys side the residents are just left at their own mercy. i cannot even flush my toilet and yet everytime someone tells me to just buy water! IF THE CITY EXPERIENCES ERRORS they need to make provision and supply residents with water! HOW LONG MUST I WAIT IN THE CALL LINE Or WAIT FOR MY WATER TO BE PUT ON ? 

so much for service delivery! i am extremely disgusted and disappointed. you are showcasing the same disregards as the ANC! }{I am now fed up with this city of cape town. I had a water leak last year and then queried it with the parow municipality. I then completed a rebate form and only received 70% of the rebate which still left me with R15 000 in arrears. I was never in arrears and because of of i have endles issues with the city of cape town. I have drafted a mail to the mayor's office regarding my issius and it was referred to ws customers  department and still waiting the outcome. They charged me R380 for disconnection fees but my water was never disconnected. Today i went to the Kuils river municipality to query the R380 and thebgirl that helped me did not know what to do and asked the guy nextbto her. I heard him saying that she must not still bother sending my query on because they are not going to look at that query still. Her answe was that she just want to send it on as if she is doing me a favour. Vrek man its my hard earnes money we talking about and how can i pay for something that did not take place. I had to make arrangements because of this and did so on the 16/10/2020 and still waitng the outcome of my query. Saturday when we bought electricity we then discovered that we got penalised because of our arrears amount even though an arrangement was in place. This is the city for you. They push you backwards and backwards till you have nothing. We all try to move forward but the city of cape town municipality just dont give a ****. I need resolution to all my queries asap and this was not of my own doing. When i heard about the underground leak i immediately phoned my insurance to fix the problem. Staff members of the water department came on my property in June last year to change my water meter because according to them there was a leak on the meter. Now if there was a leak on the meter why am i being held liable for that account and the arrears amount. They came on my property without informing me that they are coming to change the meter. I did not even know thereof. This is really pathetic how they treat our people and something must be done about it. Imagine how our elderly people in this City must feel that have the same problem. No man pathetic...... }{I have been without water for 10 days. The guys come out and all they do is reset the meter, I then have 3-4 hours of water after that. I keep telling them that something is wrong and they need to find the root cause as to why my water supply is cut off, they are so rude and refuse to speak or explain anything to me. All 3 guys from the City of Cape Town had the same horrible attitude whereby. I am utterly disgusted in the service from the City. They keep resetting the meter even though I tell them that resetting is not the solution as I will have no water this evening again and have to wait another 3 days for City to come back to the house. Not one person is putting in the effort to find what the cause is, I have never seen such unbothered, rude and lazy workers ever. This is disgusting!!!}{I have been without water since Saturday(31/10/2020) morning 10am. I called the city to lodge the issue and they gave me a reference number and advised me that the turnaround time is 24 to 48 hours. It is Monday the 02/11/2020 11:48am and still no one has attended to my problem I have called several times to find out when they will be coming, but they keep telling me about the turnaround time. When I called this morning again, I was advised that it was with the superintendant and that it was "prioritised". I do not think that the council knows what the word prioritise means. It is almost 12pm, clearly if it was a "priority" they would've been here first thing this morning.
I cannot afford to buy food anymore, I cannot ask the neighbour for water everytime. My house is stinking because I cannot flush my chain or wash my dishes. My kids went to school without washing this morning. This is flippin ridiculous service especially in the time of this pandemic.

I have a list of reference numbers as long as my arm reporting a faulty water meter, as one does because that's the right thing to do and not use water without paying for it.
When I call to follow up, I am told by the COCT consultant that we denied them access to the property to replace the meter. Our meter is on the council side of our property and they therefore don't need access to the property. We have been working from home due to the pandemic and our home office face the road and would see if they are working on the meter. I can honestly tell you that they have not been there from the 3 August when we logged the request till today. I'm tired of calling in to be lied to again. COCT you welcome to contact me and I will give you all the reference numbers for you to investigate. 
Can I also add that they left us without water for 3 days because their contractors also lied about not being given access. }{with prices constantly rising how about a little service once in a while}{BEEN TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF THE CUSTOMER CENTRE for the last 5 days. waiting on the calls for at least 20 minutes a day. absolutely pathetic municipality that wnt to claim they are the best. YET they can overcharge and do not service their communities. THEY DO NOT WORK FOR YOU. they are only interested in filling their own pockets and dont even care about answering a phone call.

during these times with restricted movements, you rely on customer care/service and, wel,l the city of cape town AGAIN just bullies the consumers by not providing a paid service.

the DA run municipality are as corrupt as the rest of south africa and is slowly killing the people falling under their jurisdiction. 

I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW UTTERLY DISGUSTED I AM BY THEIR LACK OF SERVICE. CAN'T EVEN ANSWER A STUPID CALL
}{On the14.08.2020 I was scheduled to write my learners test at 11:00 am at Phillipi East (Joe Gqabi) Traffic Department. 

Unfortunately while driving there (my uncle was driving us) our car drove into a pothole and a tyre punctured so we had to change it so long story short, We got to the Traffic Department at 11:07 and we were told to go to class. 

When we got there the guy who was supervising the class asked us to come to his desk, while trying to explain what happened he ask for our names we gave them to him and he gave us our photos back and said we should go and book another date didn’t even want to hear us out. And my observation the class had not even begun as he was busy handing out the material to the people.

My problem is that on the receipt they gave us when we booked nothing was mentioned about the fact that if you are late you would have to book another date only that “late coming will not be tolerated”.

When I tried to get assistance so that I can speak to someone about my grievances I was told to wait outside with a group of other people who were also waiting for a guy called “Mr Phillips” who seemed to be out of the office as we had to wait for more than 2 hours with no help. And I don’t think they understand the queues we stand in when we come to make bookings and I want to know if forfeited the booking fee in all of this and where are these rules written because when you book a date you are not told about any of this.}{I paid for my motor vehicle licence renewal online and for a week l didnt get a response from them and when l went in to civic centre l was told the payment hasnt appeared and was told to pay again in cash and then l was adviced l will get my refund once it appears and now it has been a week they dont respond to my emails and never answer their calls and l have proof of payment for both transactions.
The city is not responding to me now after l have paid twice.}{I have just received a bill via email for 5k payable immediately for rates and taxes, however, I have never once received a monthly account. I called customer care and spoke to Nosipho, who advised me that the account was posted to us. Not once have I received this. I asked her if I could update my postal address or if they could email me a monthly statement and I was advised that they are only doing essential services and I must wait until after lockdown to change this as no one could assist. I asked if I could set up a debit order or make a payment arrangement, I was told I must go down to the city office to make an arrangement. She then told me that they have emailed me this account as it means they will be proceeding with legal action if I do not pay the account now in full. I also received an email from a *********** email asking if they could email me statements as the post has been undelivered. So this should all tell them that I have never received an account, yet they can proceed with legal action against me if not paid in full but cannot update an email address? How is this acceptable and legal especially during a pandemic where people have lost jobs and income and where the post office has been closed and not even delivering mail. Pathetic service from a pathetic government, always trying to f**k the people! }{Just a quick note to praise the service of employee Liezl Japhta in the Strand Office. She's always very quick to respond to my e-mails and solves all my municipality account queries without a hitch. Excellent service, which means I never physically have to go to the municipal office.}{I submitted my on-line application for the renewal of my car licence and paid on the 14 July 2020 at the bank. As I had not received the licence by post by the 29 July 2020 (it should have taken 8 to 10 days) I emailed the licence dept on the morning of the 29th. I received a phone call from Ms. Ms. Shamila Amadien (licensing dept) about an hour or so who immediately followed up and arranged with her colleague, Ms. Geraldine at the Plumstead office to give me a re-print of the licence. (Plumstead is closer to my home). I went this morning (30 July) and was given priority and was promptly given the re-print. 
I must commend both ladies for the  excellent service. 
Thank you so much! I really appreciate your assistance. }{The power went off on Sunday morning @9 and up until today 28 July 20, we still have no electricity. This is due to thief's that tried to steal the cables. 

We called on Sunday, we called on Monday and still no luck and no power.

We have no means of preparing food and the meats are going off in the freezer.
What makes matters worse for me. I have 9 month old that I need to prepare bottles for.

Stad Kaapstad het 'n bandopname wat vra "Elke Kapenaar moet water bespaar." Ek was verskeie kere by Kuilsrivier Munisipaliteit om te vra dat die waterverbruik by my eiendom verlaag moet word. STAD KAAPSTAD WEIER OM DIT TE DOEN. My eiendom word onwettig beset deur somaliërs wat skynbaar handel dryf met Munisipale (MY) water. Die hele erf TE MURRAYSTRAAR 27 staan vol groot kanne water en die waterrekening draai gereeld by R5,000.00. STAD KAAPSTAD LAAT DIT TOE. Notification ********** van 15/01/2020.

Today I had a dropoff at breakwater apartments in waterfront and stood in the loading zone just before the building. Then from across the road, someone shouted at me, when I looked up it was a traffic officer, I could not hear what he was saying as he approached me. Then still shouting from across the road he isni was delivering or collecting, I said yes, he asked do I work for a courier company, I said yes, he said my vehicle was not marked and by now he was by my vehicle and was checking  the licence disc, I told him I could show him my paperwork if he needed to see it. Then I asked him why did he shout at me and not confront me in a civil manner, his lame excuse was that he was not that far, but him shouting at me would obviously mean I would have to shout a reply which is utterly disgusting. When I asked him again why did he feel the need to shout, he pulled ranked and got defensive and said well if you come with an attitude I'm going to charge you. By this time I walked away, as I needed to do my delivery. I also told him i would be 5 minutes. When I returned to my vehicle, I found a ticket against my window of which I cannot makeout heads or tails of what this officer wrote.  I am utterly disgusted that someone that does not know how to speak to people is put in a position of authority, a glorified metermaid! The officer in question is, J Frederick's, i would assume he is from Gallow Hills traffic department. I have seen him before in waterfront walking, so he is not a vehicled officer. Clearly he must not deal with people just cars, or he needs to go on a course that would allow him to converse with people in a civil manner as he is not dealing with animals.

Further I would like a verbal apology from this officer who felt the need to threaten me with his rank!}{Please advise who I can speak to with regards to a warrant on my name which I'm unable to pay because no warrant has been issued this has been ongoing for 2 years now and  no one can help me and I have a vehicle on my name which I'm unable to get a license renewal because of this admin mark.


I've been to traffic department after traffic department and no one can give me a way forward. I've called greenpoint traffic department multiple times and there is never an answer.

}{My son has been trying for 3 days now to register a vehicle on his name at the Parow Municipal Offices in Cape Town. On day 2, which was Friday 19 June, he was standing in a queue from 7:30 - 16:30. Ta few of them in the line got a numbered ticket and was told to come back on Monday 22 June. He went there again this morning from 7:30 only to be told they have to wait in a queue again. The ticket that they go means nothing. I fully understand that the lock-down caused a huge back-log, but it's like the staff at the municipal offices just care about the people waiting in the queues. they still take their lunch and tea-breaks and make the people wait. The person in charge talks with disrespect to the people waiting in the line. It seems like the more people complain, the ruder he gets.  I think this is absolutely ridiculous and super frustrating. Most of those people already don't have money and have to travel back and forth, spending entire days, only to be told that can't be assisted. I'm sure there are better ways of managing this process. I tried calling the mayor's office to find out what can be done to speed up the service there or who I can complain to. It's been an hour now (12pm) and I still haven't heard back from anyone. This City promises to work for its people, but at the moment its not doing anything for anybody at all.}{I live in Philippi, the municipal box got faulty about 3 weeks ago. I reported the fault using the provided channels, a week later came the guys to check it out. They could not solve the issue as they said it is not their department to solve it, they referred the log to the relevant department. I followed up after a week and the response i got is that in the area i live in they are being robbed. I suggested that I come and fetch the person to do this as this person will just replace the box and i take him back to the office. They literally ignored my request. I am an essential worker working from home, now I cannot perform my duties as I need to constantly charge my laptop from the neighbor's house. there are more things I cannot do right now as I'm constantly ignored on my request to fix this box. I really do not know what to do right now. also if i can call an electrician to by pass the box that too will be a problem for me as the municipality that refuses to help me will fine me. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP !!!!  }{Billing.
1)  Due to covid-19 lock-down water/sewage reading were estimated and not read
2)  The bills were issued and paid
3)  End of May they took a reading and saw that their estimates were off
4)  The __refunded__ me the amounts already paid for water and sewage 
5)  Then they billed me for the total usage since the last actual reading

Sounds fair, right?  The problem is that they use this evil sliding scale which discriminates against larger families AND since we have all been home due to the lock-down, our water/sewage usage was more.
Now, re-billing me for water/sewage already used means that the PAID for water/sewage is now being billed again as if I used 3 months worth in one month, meaning that two months worth is now charged at 'level 3'.

Level 3 in dystopia is DOUBLE the standard rate.  This effectively means that I 'owe' them about a R1000 EXTRA for something already paid for! 

So I naturally mail the evil-doers at *********** and water@capetown,gov.za and the absolute obtuse  paper-weights simply insist that if I dispute the USAGE I should provide proof.  They simply cannot see the obvious corruption. 
I lodged a complaint with the ombudsman (*********** & web) and I am still waiting for a reply.
I contacted SA Consumer Rights and they said that they charge more than the amount disputed.
I am SURE I am not the only one being robbed here.
}{We have had a water leak since the 2nd March 2020, we have reported it three times with three new reference numbers give each time and escalated on numerous occasions. We have lost countless amounts of good water even though we are still in a drought and our complex is incurring huge issues due to this. The paving is collapsing and the area around the man holes is eroding and sinking. Will it take someone getting seriously hurt to get action. I sent a message on Twitter to try get action on Wednesday, 10th June 2020 and some men came around to pump this and take photo's, we asked them to take photo's of the damage as we will hold the COCT liable. To date we have water running out the manhole due to the rain and the paving collapsing more. Below is the message send on Twitter on the 10th to maybe invoke the action we got then, but I keep getting messages about escalating etc., attached are also photos of the damage and waste of water:
We reported a burst pipe for our complex in 2 March 2020 with Ref # ********** then again we followed up with a new Ref # ********** and then again a new Ref # ********** and still nothing has happened. Are we not still in a drought where water wasted at this level is unacceptable?!? Now not only has gallons of water been wasted but our complex paving and the area around the pipe is sinking and collapsing. We will hold COCT liable for this damage but after numerous calls and follow ups no one has come to fix this very severe issue. No one phones back as promised after escalating}{I made a hall booking for the Brackenfell Hall on 4 September 2019 and paid the R838 refundable deposit. In December 2019, I requested a refund as the function that was booked for February 2020 has been canceled.  

It has now been 6 months and I still have not received my refund. 

This is seriously pathetic.}{I have logged a fault with the City of Cape Town Municipality on 11/06/2020 advising them that there was no power in the area- i received a reference number of **********. The premises belongs to my parents and they have been informed earlier in the week that they were Covid-19 positive as they both work for the Health department. My father is diabetic and his medication needs to be refrigerated at all times. The power came back on as of the same day, however the power went out again and I made calls which were basically dead ends. On the 12th which was the day after, power went out again around 6am and I reported a fault AGAIN to the municipality. This morning I sent them an email AGAIN their response was, I quote "Good morning - Please speak to your ward Councillor as there is nothing from our side we can do"
I feel that just because its a BLACK area, our services are not that essential as compared to other areas but we pay our rates every month - to my understanding ELECTRICITY is an essential to every citizen of South Africa. Its been over 48hrs since we had no power and we are being told to speak to our councilor whom we don't even know. Just worried about the health of my parents.}{I was at the Green point office this morning at 07:00 my appointment was at 08:00 I told the officer I was first called by a guy to come and writte on the 28 May and when I got there was no one. Received another call on the 1 June 2020  that I must come today to write my learners and I showed proof of a call they told me they can't find my writing form and they were giving me so much attitude telling me I must wait for 12:00 to rite or I must book again for another date they were so rude  Ludski Conrade, Gelenman Mnyamana and Sastaftha Moegamad.  I left there without any help and it's running I'm cape town and I am using public transport all the wy from Khayelitsha and I don't have money for this up and down I am currently unemployed because of lockdown. Please kindly attend this matter as urgent . Please contact me on ********** or ***********
}{I have been trying for hours to get a hold of someone at the City of Cape Town municipality, to no avail as there are no operators due to Covid 19. I then smsed the number given and nothing had happened. Our electricity has been off for more than 5 hours now. With it switching back on intermittently for 2 min around past 5 and then off again. This is ridiculous, we are paying customers, at least have the decency to inform us if there is maintenance . It's after sunset and we are still in the dark. Terrible service. }{For some odd reason I have been calling the municipal offices to try and get some assistance with the water meter that they fitted to the already existing old school meter that came with my property when I bought it.

What I have been complaining about is the inconsistencies of the rates and taxes that have been levied on me as an owner as the figures are always estimated and not true actual readings.... And when I query that, whoever that answers the calls in most cases they sell you lies by telling you that they will send out someone and that never happens and even when you ask for a reference number, they hang up on you before you get one... When you follow up on the call, you start the process all over again to no avail. 

I suspect that the municipality is remotely toying with my water pressure, but they bill me exorbitant amounts in water usage and I stay in a household of just two adults and an infants. 

But one finds himself paying in excess of R1000. 00 almost every month, only now since lockdown am I really getting a true reflection of my usage and amazingly my usage has dropped drastically. 

Someone needs to audit the municipal offices of City of Cape Town because I suspect that they are cooking the books and residents bear the brunt of thier greed. }{I have called and called been without electricity for 4 days they keep saying someone will come no1 has come this is ridiculous. They are pathetic. They can't even do their job properly.}{For the pass few days we have been struggling with drains over flowing. We cannot even open our gates it's like Delft Suburban Appelkoos street and Kremetart street are forgotten. We call the CCT and we get put on hold so long our airtime runs out we live with sewerage water and they do nothing about it. I ha e to say CCT is real real bad }{I logged a call for a blocked sewerage at our home and 20 minutes after the call has been logged, the guys were here.

Thanks, great service!}{Good day. 

I reported a water leak on Sunday 24/05/2020.  Monday morning, COCT officials were outside my place and before I could get to them, they disappeared.
Only to realise later, my water was switched off. No notification at all. 

Made numerous calls to **********and spoke to 6 different agents.
24/05/2020 - Mapule - logged
25/05/2020 - Cele  10:10 Olivia 14:15 and Louis  19:20
26/05/2020 - Hadley 07:45 and Sipho 16:30
27/05/2020 - Macebo 18:10

Giving the same standard blank and blunt answers namely  'task team assigned to it, it was reported, shortstaffed, Covid19, enquiry was logged wrong, slow system, and quite a few apologies.

This is day 4 28/05/2020 without water.  Let me add, the water in the road is still gushing out but my house........ there is no WATER, so I have to go and purchase water at the shops (essential enough I hope) 
Only to run into a Metro Police Officer asking me why am on the road during one of those 4 days but we will not get into that. Once again, City of Cape Town.

Why am I the only person in the road without water? As explained in one of the calls, a shut off was done. 
Keep safe I can do,  keep clean and wash hands I can not.  How does this help?

Next thing you going to tell 'WE MUST SAVE WATER' - when the water been leaking in my road for 4-5 days or even worse 'tell me i must have it fixed myself and sit with massive water bill. Who knows???

The City works for you was the slogan, changed to the Caring City, less of this nonsense. When people speak about their issues regarding the City of Cape Town Municipality, one normally turns a blind eye. Only to realise once it happens to you, how poor service can be. 

It could be wrong of me to circle the whole Municipality instead of the department where this is directed at. Water and Sanitation.  

At the end of the day, service delivery is service delivery. ONE BANNER, ONE CITY.

I really hope someone after reading this review/email can be the difference or lets say 'the late difference' and prevent the saying 'it’s time to go one step further' 

End of the day we all have a right to speak and a job to do.
It was my job to report this issue at first, COCT is your job to repair is this issue and supply me with THE WATER I have to pay COCT on a monthly bases - RATES AND TAXES

I have a reference number ********** and a contact number **********.}{I monitor my home's water usage constantly and of late since the level 4 lockdown kicked into effect... I've noted that my taps have started leaking including noting a foul smell coming from both toilets in my house, after really looking into the toilets matter.... I then realized that the municipality actually lowered the water pressure as before the lockdown came into effect.... My house water pressure was normal and now all of a sudden the pressure has changed and yet my rates and taxes are always exorbitant for a household of just two people.

Am I suffering as a result of not being on a prepaid meter? I ask myself}{We submit our own electricity readings and have been doing so for some time as the guys have a hard time entering our premises.
My mom used to wtrite down their number, they not digital so sometimes had a hard time and of course had issues or made mistakes. 
The time in question was since updated but we received a bill for over 9k for 2 months now I know for a fact that this is incorrect however after both my mom and I sending the corrected info they have not changed the amount and we need something to be done about this immediatly. 
I have since sent the latest and corrected info to them but still they keep sending the amount of 9k!! 9K is more than 6-9 months usage as its a single standing home!
Please look into this with utmost importance.
My mom has since passed away so its now falling to me to look into this. }{I live in Makhaza 33 section and a pole burnt down Sunday 19:15 it was reported by myself and up until today (Wednesday) no one is fixing the problem i have been wasting my airtime and calling non stop all i get is that they have fixed the error and that they have resolved they matter but still we have no electricity its so sad how black communities are suffering from not getting service delivery if Eskom is using private companies why dont they check their credentials and if they are capable of fixing anything, i am working from home and i might get unpaids because of this nonsense i am so irrate right now. Their service is disgusting }{On Saturday raw sewerage started bubbling up through a vent in my backyard. I phoned City of Cape Town and a friendly, efficient woman immediately logged a query. I received an email with a reference number within minutes. Three hours later a team of workers came to sort the problem out. A Mr Moses Abrahams was one of the team an swiftly fugured out what the problem was and within minutes the drain was unclogged and my yard was clean. Thank you so much City of Cape Town!! Much appreciated! }{It is my opinion that with the Lockdown lots of People became concerned about their Rates Account Payments, Renewal of Motor Vehicle Licence, Water Bills that will accumulate over the Lockdown Period with Municipalities being Closed etc. No clear guidelines were either Published or Televised by Municipalities more so in the District of Cape Town where I live. In addition I was Fined by one of their Traffic Officers for an Emergency Medical Stop at a Cafe to buy my wife a COKE to prevent her going into a Diabetic Comma. Despite my every affords to explain to the Officer what is happening he just wasn't interested. Perhaps the City should better train and educate their Officers to listen to us Drivers first before issuing FINES. I was fined for stopping in front of a Cafe in Claremont .    }{can anyone assist as still waiting to hear back from city.I have calculated my property rates increase at 22% yet city says it went up by 4% which I paid end april.Has anybody had similar experience.Also is rates not suppose to increase in june }{They don't even deserve 1 damn star. I called the COCT on the 17th April 2020 because we discovered a leakage on our property, Ref: **********. I was told that in the 4th I could go to the accounts office for a rebate because the leakage caused a huge spike in our water bill. I went this morning, they were rude and unhelpful and the offices was closed. }{On 12 April, I logged a no power fault (Ref: **********) On the same day a service bakkie came and fixed the power. Reason: the overhead electricity power box, switch tripped) Once again on 3 May during the early hours of the morning(before 4am) We had no power. Logged request ref: **********. Later during the day a service bakkie came, not even 10 minutes on my property, they decided an engineer needs to come out and left. So it is currently Ramadan, we require electricity, not just because of the obvious, we actually paying for electricity, but our day starts before sunrise and end at sunset. Myself, my daughter and her 1 year old requires nebulizer support at any given time. (which I mentioned to'***********') It is now the morning of 5 May, still no electricity. Due to my generous neighbor thy supplying us with a lead for bare essential power support. In case you wondering how can I type this complaint with no power. If I  burn tyres, maybe it will get sorted out quicker}{Good day. I would like to express my utter disgust with the City of Cape Town municipality. My mom is a pensioner and they send her these exorbitant bills for water and electricity. They don’t bill what the meter says because their meter readers stopped taking readings long before the lockdown. So i have taken pictures of the meters, both the electricity and water meters. They have a sms system that don’t work. How is that for a City that works for you! Pathetic. I don’t have a problem paying the bill but i refuse to pay for something that’s not accurate. It is not the first time. Their service at the municipal buildings is pathetic. They condescending and arrogant. When you call you hold on for more than an hour. }{I had an issue in 2018 that i couldn't get resolved and then ended up sending an email to the Mayors office. soon after that i received acknowledgement. The municipality supposedly wrote off fees in 2012 and then when i had a credit due to me from a different property they took that. Then in July last year they pace a random debit of R1500+ to my account with no explanation. Floris Theart was very efficient in reverting back to me however constantly provide me with legal extracts stating the Municipality can do this. All i wanted was something that made sense to me. The cherry on the cake was the last email received from Floris stating the following: "Dear Almacin, You are really taken to much time off my schedule
Please visit the office in Strand after lock down". - WOW - It took me more than a year back and forth with local municipality and call center's and now you send me back there? What's so sad is that people like Foris are entrusted with a role that they don't have time for!!!! - I would have totally understood had they said that all issues would be dealt with after lockdown because there were maybe more pressing matters to attend to. I could have waited a little while longer considering I've waited so long already.  I didn't know that people in the Municipality get paid to do what is meaningful to them and not the citizens of this country!!!!}{The continued good level of service during the lockdown from the City of Cape Town needs to be applauded. We experienced a blocked sewage pipe in Hout Bay, which we could not clear ourselves, so we advised the Water section of the City which handles all complaints. 24 hours later, a crew arrived last night at 19:00 and cleared the blockage. In times like these, we regard this as excellent service and it is good to know, that there are dedicated people keeping our City going - proud to live in the only functional area in SA.}{At around midnight last night all the power sockets at home went dead. The computers, the Internet, and more worrying the fridge were all without power. All this in the midst of the lockdown, and with only skeleton staff deployed by the municipality. I did not feel much hope but went on the Cape Town Municipality site and reported the problem. I already had plans to chain extension cords from the neighbour to keep the fridge alive. I slept late and woke up to the news that !contractors arrived at 8 and that power had already been restored. What amazing news, and what amazing service!}{I would like to acknowledge the electricity department and in particular Anwar and Prosper for their amazing service this morning. We woke up to no power this morning and logged an electricity fault this morning at 7 46 am under fault number **********. Within an hour Anwar and Prosper arrived at our premises to rectify the fault and within an hour after re cabling the faulty section power was restored. What made this even more amazing was that given this period of lockdown and operations in skeleton staff the service delivery was fantastic . Thank you}{I contacted the City of Cape Town on Monday, 30 March 2020, with regards to a damaged municipal refuse bin following collection and spoke with a very helpful agent. I immediately received an SMS with a reference number. Today, 2 April 2020, I received a call from a gentleman from the City of Cape Town to ask that we place the damaged bin outside our property for replacement. This is excellent service amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Thank you City of Cape Town.}{I need to compliment the Western Cape on their maintenance and creation of infra structure in this province. It is wonderful to see the work that it thus creates and it makes our lives so much better. Thank you. And thank you to all those people working on the roads...standing in the sun and wind with impatient traffikers not always  appreciating their incredible hard work. I would like it if Alan Winde would put monuments along all  roads and bridges listing each and every person' name  involved in all these new and upgraded roads and bridges to thank them and to pay tribute to their incredible hard and so far thankless work. I see how they work at night when all sleep, tarring the roads. How they stand in blistering sun waving their flags, how they bow down laying the new roads and running to put up barriers. Wind, rain or shine. Thank you to you all...you are doing an amazing job.}{Very happy with the agents I dealt with, very informative and helpful}{Recently arranged at the Plumstead offices that all our vehicle licenses are synchronised to the same month, so as to visit their office only once in a year. Staff were helpful, renewed all licenses without hassles and we paid by credit card.
If the city would now invest in a ticketing system so that this queue moving from chair to chair would stop, then it would be wonderful.}{On 20 February 2020 we had a water mains break under the pavement outside our house. It is the mains that leads into our house and so I shut the tap on the meter box to save water, which had flooded our street. 
I reported it immediately. Then 5 days later I reported it again. Then I did a temporary 'fix' so we could flush toilets and do some washing. Then 2 days later I noticed the hole in the pavement was filled in and assumed the CoCT water team had fixed the problem...later that day the water mains burst again, and I turned off the water again, which had flooded our street. 
I reported it again. 
Then again yesterday.
Each time I'm told it will take "one working day" - not true. 
It's not helpful to assume a) the service provider (CoCT) is trustworthy, b) that the service provider is expert/professional, c) water loss is still a priority. 
Perhaps this is the real meaning of Private/Public partnership...that I must get a private professional to repair a pipe that was damaged by OCTOTEL's contract with CoCT to lay Fibre lines into our neighbourhood. }{On the 5th February I called as I suspected something was wrong with my meter due to receiving two accounts for astronomically high water usage which is nowhere near what I usually use or pay. Was told someone would come to look. Twenty minutes after someone did come, who told me meter was faulty and would need replacing. Said they'd come to put in new meter and that it should take a day. Nothing happened. Called again on the 10/11th was told to wait 3 days. Nothing happened. Called on the 13th was told to wait again. Still nothing. On the 18th called again, told to wait 48 hours, and was given request no. Nothing happened.
Tried to contact them again on the 25th but lines were down. On this same day a neighbour informed me there was a water running in front of my house in the street where the meter is. My neighbour tried valiantly to assist in getting someone out as well. On the 26th someone from city council drove by noticed the water and asked if we knew and promptly left. Another drove passed later who switched the water off. At around 8pm that evening city council service members from ottery arrived not aware of my calls or the other council workers who'd been there earlier nor of my neighbour who'd tried to help contacting municipality. They preceded to repair the leak but not the meter. Till now, nobody has been back to fix the faulty meter or enquire of any follow ups. My account needs to be adjusted as my account went up drastically from my usual account which is why I had been calling in the first place. All of this could have been prevented if someone had done their job sooner rather than wait till a leak appeared..}{We all know that trying to get an answer from a municipality is like finding a needle in a haystack.

But you should know that perhaps your are getting too close to the needle when your email is blocked by the municipality?}{When I reported a water leak the City sent people out who ruined my driveway, leaving a huge mound of dirt and gravel that covered half the driveway. I logged another call to have this repaired on 21 January. I followed up several times and was always told that the service time is 21 working days. After 21 working days had expired I followed up again and was told that the matter has now been escalated and I will be contacted within 24 hours by the contractor. This was over a week ago. When I called back this morning, I was now told that the call has NOT been escalated and that the service time is 30 working days, not 21 working days. The story keeps changing and in any case today is 30 working days since I logged the call but the agent told me she cannot give any indication when it might be fixed.}{I've over charged monthky by the munipality for months now, in November I was charged for 3 months, and the munipality stated that they undercharged hence the massive bill. Every month I've a payment of over 2000 which is ridiculous and we barely consume much electricity and use grey water. This mo th I've been charged yet again over 2000 and was told I'm being billed for two months, my readings which Ive been sending through every month was not taken into account at all and I've queried this via mail and telephonically and have received absolutely no help. Not to mention the arrogant attitudes you receive at the City of Cape Town offices. Its absolutely disgusting how the CCT rips you off and tries and steal your money, disgusting!!!}{Sending me Traffic fines not due to me- why dont you stop the driver and verify whether im the owner or not car got sold as s**** to mechanic..so he might not be paying even vehicle registration and so on...Wake up city of cape ...stop e-mailing me and start being hands on and investigate..e-mails wont solve anything}{I am deeply disappointed by a certain traffic official Mr R Witbooi. 

I work in belville near the metropolitan building. 
The bus drivers for metropolitan like to takeover this stretch of road. The park in other companies loading bays. And when they see another car parking in that loading bay.

The call Mr R Witbooi. Who comes and gives tickets so that those cars can move.

He gives tickets two days in a row for the same offense(licence disk not shown) even though another traffic officer issued a ticket stating the vehicle may not be issued a fine within 14 days.

The will be other cars parking on the yellow line two cars away from where he is but he will not walk 10 steps to issue that car a fine, because that car doesnt not effect  his friends parking.

You are a traffic official you work for the city of cape town. Not the bus drivers! }{I purchased electricity at 7.15 am and again at 7.29 am on 23 February 2020, both for R100 and only received the one voucher. Not sure who to contact regarding this though? }{I went for four days to Macassar resort. It's almost three months and I still haven't received my deposit back. There are supposed to pay it back within 30 days. I've been calling every week since the end of December but everytime I call they keep on saying I must phone next week or it's been processed. Anelia from the resort's office , that she can't give me any details whatsoever for the headoffices. I want my money.}{Sunday morning 16th February, before church we woke up and realize we had no water in our taps. The new digital water meter was installed a few months ago and we had experienced minor issues but this time it is different. Once we realized we had no water we immediately had a look at the water meter reader and it was completely off. My husband called the customercare line of the municipality and they logged the call giving us a reference number **********. They told us it might take up to 48hours before someone will come out to assess the problem. Today is the 19th of February,  the 4th day without water. After calling to follow up and going in to the office in parow, it seems like everyone was trained to say the same thing . 48hours has long passed. We are a family of 7 which includes a 4 year old and 2 sick elderly. Our health is at risk at this stage. Don't they realize how important it is to have water. I guess not but in your daily lives you are preached about health. Can anybody help me reach this message out to the right persons. }{The following pertains to the various sports complexes in Mitchells Plain specifically Lentegeur Sports Complex on Morgenster road. The local council and its various sub committees has done nothing in the last few years to the up keep of this complex and whenever issues are taken to there departments doorsteps there is political blocks, excuses for not doing certain things which is part and parcel of there various departments to the up keep, safety, maintenance etc of the sports complex. Budgets are always an issue but there is no proof of what the budget for the sports complex was used for if all the funds was allocated and used correctly if it was used at all.}{I am so disgusted and embarrassed to be part of a country where they just dont care about humanity. Our water just switch for almost 2 days ago. I called COCT Municipality and all they did was give me a reference number and said I have to wait 24 hours for a contractor to come and check why my water isnt working. After 24 hours I called again just to be told that our query was handed to a contractor in Wynberg and that the supervisor will call me. I waited all day I got hom and no1 has been at my home to check why our water isnt working. I called again and was told Zefron Contractors has my deeds and will come and check out our issue but we have to wait 48 hours because this is within the service delivery promise...We have kids in this house and my 1 year old nephew is I'll we have no water and the city dont give a **** about us all I'm told is that there is nothing that can be done as I am in a queue and just have to wait my turn. I even called Zefron to their office number which just rings with no answer. What type of contractors does government use that doesnt have phones that are answered and coct municipality contact centre agents that dont give a flip....You have to pay tax and accept all the rising tariffs but when you sitting with no water at the fault of the coct municipality they can't help u...I feel so helpless. I have been calling all day today everyday a million calls later still no help. What do I do? Help!!!!}{I woke up Monday morning 10 February 2020 with a massif sinus headache and as miserable as a new Michelin Tyre full of nails. My wife had been complaining about a hole in our dirt-bin ("wheely-bin") as well as when will I be phoning the "Dirt People" about replacing it. I wasn't sure anyone would just be replacing it, who the "Dirt People" are or that only males could call them, but also not brave enough to forgo any of the privileges handed out by the mistress. I therefore phoned the City of Cape Town number **********) as indicated on Google. 

TARAA!! I spoke to Super Municipal Employee: Lynette who with a voice sounding like a smile, in no time took my particulars and informed me that it would take a maximum of 14 days to deliver as well as to contact the same number if it wasn't and that they will sort it out on my behalf. I also need to mention that I forgot my municipal account that has the reference number necessary for performing this function, but she in no time at all looked it up on her system and did what was necessary. 

What is even more surprising was the delivery of the bin early the next morning. 14 days????? Super employees. The guys delivering also told the love of my life that the old bins get recycled and that made her extremely happy. Leading to more happiness for me.

Good on you Lynette and Bin Guys. I hope the boss gets to read this review.}{I am not happy with the lies , I am told by the CCT consultants and always getting different stories. I had a faulty meter box and i called and on the 12 Jan2020 and electrician came to replace it. I was told by that guy within 7 days i will get my electricity units back from the old meter box. I have been calling ever since and have been giving different stories and when i ask for feedback  i am told someone will call me. That has never happened and now today when i cal again using my airtime while holding forever , this guy tell me that i have to waiting for another 14 days  and i ask him did the other guys lied when they said its 7 days and he said yes and now i am
Wondering why must i trust him when he says some one will call me on Monday. The ref********** . I paid for that electricity and i want it back before the end of this week. I will report this further if i don't get a reply }{The traffic lights on the R300 to Jacques Gerwel Drive was off during loadshedding.
This is a major road interchaning and you could not keep the lights on for 2 and a half hours or send a traffic cop ???.

The same thing happened on Suikerbossies/Frans Conradie during loadshedding in the afternoon ... a major interchange and the robots were off and no traffic cops in sight

Pathetic.}{4days without power

5 x requests were sent it on ********** line.

We are still out of power and  when we ca to report your agents are very unhelpful and unprofessional for contact centre. 

I called the day we were our of power and was assured that someone is sent and his on the way. 

Technicians were never on scene ee as the community waited for tgem as we were out of power while other houses had power. 

We kept on callin in and i was told that technician are on scene which never happened and time went by and i called again and was told no they are resetting the power stations around my area which was false.

After a while i called in again and was told that the technician confirm its too late they can't respond area is dangerous while previously we were told the above stated.

Our fridges are defrosted, Food is off now we are still facing difficulties the technicians haven't yet been sent to out while we followed the right channels to report the issues

}{I had been trying to get help from the City of Cape Town via emails since 17 January 2020 how to set up an account to pay them via EFT.  They do NOT reply so I think they just IGNORE clients. It seems the municipality us not interested in client services or consumer satisfaction with services.
As with so many problems in SA and persons not fulfilling their work duties, no wonder the country is non-functional. What a shame to be living in a country where NOTHING works. }{Dear Customer. CCT Service Request ********** for Sewer: Blocked/Overflow has been logged. This was handled with the necessary urgency and importance as per their normal standards. Thank you to the City of Cape town team you are living up to your promise to make this City work for us!!!}{No service at the electrical department in wynberg 2 customers standing but no service ladies busy with there own thing don't care about customers.

They look for faults not to help you }{Municipal workers smashed my car window by accident while cutting grass on the side of the road. Got all the details everything seems to progress until the Admin Officer: Treasury: Finance Directorate who tells me it will take 3 months to replace my car window... typical. Then she says the onnus is on me to park my car safely while I'm out until that time lol. This was after trying to get progress updates out of them for 2 weeks. 1 phone call to Outsurance and will be replaced within 24 hours. Once I cancelled the claim from COCT suddenly I'm getting calls from them. Every email they start with the phrase 'without prejudice' lol. I give up with these people... TLDR: Cost me the loss of a no claim bonus of R700 and an excess of R280 to fix what they broke. RiP Cape Town}{Disappointed is an understatement, my parents are both pensioners, owners of the measly Sassa pension each month. My problem is then on Thursday 23rd of January 2020, their water was shut off!
My mother then went the next day to the local offices at Prominade mall to make arrangements and mayb pay whatever she has on hand so that their water could be put on. 
She was told to apply indigenous fund which will help in the long run. Their water should be on in the next 48 hrs. 
Come the Saturday, she got a call from said office, a lady, which told her to come by the office and to bring her and my father's sassa cards, which she did. 

After sitting in a long cue, the person at the window told her she needs to pay upfront an amount of R750, which she didn't have at that moment. 
I sent her the money and she went back to office, only to find that she needs to pay an amount of R1100 before they can switch on her properties water. 
Unfortunately, sassa only pays out pension fund on the 1st, so my parents will have to be without water for the rest of the week which I think is inhuman. }{The City of Cape Town Municipality promises on proving good service and communication. Both of these promises have not been fulfilled by them in this particular incident.

Our water has been off since the 14 January 2020 today marking the 10th day our water has been off. There is a default on our meter and has been tagged as a electronic issue. 

 
I have called them daily some days a few times a day, i have gone into the nearest municipality, i have emailed them and still our water is off. Yesterday after being 9 days without water they decided to come out and said they vould not fix the problem as there is a default on our water meter and the company needs to be contacted. We were also promised that the issue would be sorted out by today.

Nothing is being done about the issue. We are still without water. The service delivery is pathetic! }{I reside in Hanover Park and a few years ago our flats were renovated but more damage was done to say the least. Our water pipes and meters got incorrectly installed and messed up the whole system ( We have 6 tenants on one stairs and tenants was unaware they they were paying the other one water bills) So when my tap is open (No33) for example (No36) meter would be running...
I realized this only when my water bill was ridiculously high. 
I went to the Cape Town Civic centre where I logged a complaint. Infact it was so high, I ended up falling behind with my water account because Im unemployed. I then received letters from the City to say that I need to make arrangement on my account to have this paid, and even though they are trying to attend / Fix this matter I should still make arrangement to avoid my water from being cut. 
Year in, year out I have been told that they still working on it, and so every year I would have to go in and make arrangement. Last year 2019 a lady from the City (Vuyiledene Abongile Gwayi) was in contact with me via email (Have all records as proof) and arranged for Donovan Isaac Snyders to contact me and come to my house to see the water meters himself which he did. He then arranged for the water guys to come and install a new meter for my house only and said he would put a hold or lock on this account of mine. New meters was installed on the 11 November 2019 but a week later this meter started leaking. I contacted him several times via email. I have also called in and received a ref number when I informed them about the leak on this water meter. Donovan has not ever contacted me again and seem to be ignoring my emails. I do not have a direct number to his office either. Today I went in to the Athlone Civic Municipality where I again logged a complaint told them that I have received 2 water accounts so far after the 11 November and that my new meter number still does not reflect on my account and the meter number they have on this statement is incorrect. My water bill is being going up ever since, and is now at almost 10k. This is so frustrating and I honestly dont know who else to speak to or go and see. }{This is specifically for the Cape Town Electricity Department.

The power in our house in Lansdowne went out on Friday afternoon, and we thought that it might have been load shedding. We checked on our neighbourhood watch and nobody else in the areas power was off. We have a electricity meter (not prepaid), and our current bill is only due next month (February).

I called the electricity department at about 6PM, waited for about an hour and spoke to Mogamad who said they are aware of houses losing power and he will get the team to come check it out, which takes about 2-3 hours. They came at about 10PM, but did not come to our house. They went to the electricity box in the road, left and and did not return.

I called again and waited for about an hour (Saturday morning), and they said they will send someone out. Nobody arrived. I had to call again to tell them nobody arrived and they agreed to send someone out, AGAIN. The team arrived 2 hours later, said that random houses are losing electricty and they will be back. They left and came back a couple of hours later and again said the same thing and left.

Its now 8PM on Saturday and I have to call the Electricity department again. Bear in mind all of these calls are not free, so I will have a huge bill from Telkom at the end of the month.

This must be the worst service I've experienced. All of the items in my fridge and freezer have gone off, our house is the only house thats dark in the road which makes it prime target for criminals and just general everyday living.

This issue is still not resolved!

}{I had to renew my licence and did so at the Civic Centre. It took 5 minutes and I got the new licence disk. The reason for the very organised and efficient way this department operates are due to enough staff, all of whom are efficient and friendly and helpful and professional. The way they organise and divert the clients' waiting in their lines are also great.  This is the second year that I experience this wonderful service. Well done and thank you. }{For the passed months, my husband and I have been emailing, smsing, calling and even sending whatsapp messages with our account details and water readings.

Our water account has been estimated and the amount is just increasing.
It has come to my attention that they do not process our reading through because of previous readings which was 3058 and ours is 2059.
They saying it does not correspond with the previous one therefore they will not capture our reading. We even sent them pictures as proof but still that doesn't help.
It's been over 4 months and still no progress. I do not understand how they expect us to keep our account up to date when its incorrect.

 Its so frustration and annoying. Even today I was not assisted but instead 
I get told they will send people to our house and I know that will not happen as I was told they do not want to send anyone out, we need to call in and give our readings.

We've done everything they asked but still nothing.

kind regards
Nomsa Matsolo}{I renewed my licence disk on 10 Dec 2019 online, I was told that I receive the disk after 8 days, I never received the disk and when I enquire I was told it was sent on 13 Dec 2019, I sent several emails requesting when am I receiving my licence and no one responded to my emails, up until I received a fine and I sent another email for the fine to be cancelled as I have not received my disk,.

A person by the name J Daniels (Corporate contact centre) responded to my email and told me that I need to send my ID and a letter to request a reprint, I sent that 09 Jan 2020 and never received any response, when I call on 15 Jan 2020 I am told that I need to send the documents again including proof of payment even thought they do see my payment and the reference that they gave me.

The truck was carrying a load of thousands of empty glass bottles. These were deposited all over the intersection such that it had to be closed to traffic from all directions. This intersection during normal hours carries one of the highest traffic densities in the city. As the rush hour mounted that morning the traffic built up for kms back along the M3 and vehicles were jammed solid down suburban streets trying to avoid the massive hold up. Why? Because the Traffic Department were nowhere to be seen except a handful officers at the intersection doing precious little. They should have been spread out in all directions directing the built up queues of vehicles along alternative routes from the M3 and Rhodes Drive. They also failed to put out any bulletins timeously over local radio stations to warn motorists of the hold up and offering alternative routes etc. The result of this chaos was that some 8 hours after the truck incident, repeat 8 hours afterwards, the intersection was still blocked in two directions due to insufficient equipment and personnel being called in by the authorities to clear the 1000s of bottles from the roadway. One front end loader and one truck crane was the best that could be produced to help with the mess plus a handful of council workers with bits of wood to push the glass off the road! I subsequently sent several emails to the Mayor's office requesting an explanation as to why this incident - which could very easily be repeated at any time in the future and was in no way unusual - was handled in such an incompetent manner by the Traffic Dept. and why the council seemed ill equipped to be able to muster sufficient equipment to rapidly clear away this type of obstruction. In spite of repeated requests and follow ups regarding this request no one at any council department has bothered to even respond with a meaningful explanation. Yet another example of an all too common bureaucratic lack of accountability so prevalent in this country today! If CTCC thinks this is what service delivery is all about I suggest they go back to school. .}{Worst service at Mitchells plain traffic department.

Great inconvenience since I had guests over.  The Call Centre agent that I spoke to last night called Lumka was very arrogant and dropped the call while I was busy speaking to her. She promised to SMS me the reference nr but I did not receive an SMS. By this evening no technician came out and again no water is available.  I called again this evening and was told to wait for a technician. Was advised that there is no such thing as an emergency and there is no manager available.  Pathetic service. I utilised the sms as well as the what's app number this evening. No response thus far.  I was appalled by the lack of empathy. Meantime I have to go another evening without water while guests are still visting since it is holiday season.  Totally unacceptable. }{As a concerned citizen, I reported a leak on the City' mains on the 29/12/2019.
Incident number: ********** as per their requests in their save water campaign.
The City responded the next day and attended to their problem.They dug a trench in front of my home and cordoned it off with danger tape and left, with no confirmation as to what was happening next. Only much later in the day when I inquired as to why I don have water, I was informed that the problem was fixed as confirmed by their call center, however the water to my property was not.  After several complaints to their call center I was told that a contractor would attend to the problem this morning. To date I am still without water and nobody at their call center has bothered to supply me with a reference number for this query or respond to my constant inquiries surrounding an ETA as to when I will have water, which is my constitutional right. It would appear that contrary to their slogan, it would appear that this City only works for certain economic centers!!

I am truly not happy with the responce given to me for a rates query on my accout about amounts that I feel are irregular on my monthly statements, and it boggles me as to why I should pay R204. 17 for me asking about my account that I make sure that is always up to date and paid up.

I am a law abiding citizen of this beautiful mother city of ours and to come to find that, I, as a rate payer must go as far as paying for a service that is supposed to be free of charge to a rate payer as, it is my account that I am querying about. As I believe, that there is a discrepancy with the amounts on my statements as I try at best to minimize usage of water and yet my bill keeps constant, and we were only three in this residence (a couple and an an infant). 

Whenever I either call in to the call center and now written email, I get told that I must again pay a fee to get assisted.

I feel that the municipality is taking me, as a paying client for granted and subsequent to that, it now brings to question as to how many other average law abiding citizens just like me, are being taken advantage of. 

More so by a municipality that rakes in millions in a day. To the municipality R204. 17 is just a drop in the ocean, but for me an individual that is trying to make ends meet, it is money that adds to covering living costs and it is to this end that I feel that I should seek legal assistance.

Mr T Chiloane }{The company I paid to draw up and submit my building plans drew up my plans and submitted it But did not complete it properly. I followed up with them regularly but they stopped responding
I then contacted the City of Cape Town and John Rangoli also tried contacting the draughtsman but to no avail. He and Bonita van Niekerk then went the extra mile for me and helped me complete the required forms and submit my plans. It took a day to get this done after "fighting" with the draughtsman for 6 months (and he got paid to do this)

Thank you John Rangoli and Bonita van Niekerk!!

}{I would like to put a complaint to Municipality of City of Cape Town , the strand branch. It’s been 3 months no street lights and it’s been reported several times no one is taking us serious as the community.  My concern is that it’s festive season where there’s high rate of crime, basically it’s so easy to be robbed and get any trouble on the dark. Please we need help.}{My grandmother has been out of water for a whole 2 months due to arrears. We settled the delequent amount on the 2nd of December and they promised that the water will start operating as per normal. When we got home still there was no changes we went back and they promised the same thing. Since we were using a lot of money to go to and fro we decided to buy airtime and call the call center, we called yesterday and they said they will be bringing someone to resolve the issue and we were given 2 references but nothing has changed till today I just called them now and spoke to a lady by the name Nosipho which says that the people who were appointed to come said that they came to the property and there was a building built on top of it but nobody came. Tell me how is an old aged woman suppose to live without water for this long? }{Got home electricity was gone. Thought its load shedding all to find out, 2 and half hours later that someone tampered with the outside box at our streeet and my house is affected. Call the municipality, spoke 2 a guy called Macebo whonwas assisting and all but our call got cut while i was confirming my address as im.already frustrated by what is going on. Call again and get through to a luwellyn guy who wasnt helpful from the start of the call, relayed the whole scenario, attitide he gave me while expressing the detaila of the tampering and he confirmed the load shedding times which i understood but fact remained, the electricity box has been tampered with and our house is the only.house without electricity, he gives me.attitude, bad customer service, while explaining not even giving me a chance yes fine macebo logged the query when my call.got cut which m.very helpful for.but for this luwellyn giy to cut me off like im some stupid ***** who is just rambling is unprofessional. Im reallt disgusted by his customer services. He should be able.to.understand out frustrations as people we wont just call if we did know.what the procedure was or the cause of the matter was. The city's call cebtre people are rude. Im so disgusted by his behavior cause clearly my call wasnt that important to him..when i asked him about SLA he said its 3- 4 hours which is riduculous but i guess i will have to accept cause of who i was to him when he gave me attitude. If the city is enploying staff to treat clients like.**** then m.sorty cape town will remain the province that it is where there is no.unity whatsoever. Im SO DISGUSTED BY HIS BEHAVIOUR!!
}{We are situated in Driftsands in an informal settlement call Sophakama .we have been asking for service delivery the place that we live in is very very dirty we have DUMPING SITE with reeds ,We asked for the TOILETS and as a result of us not having toilets the people are dumping there in that dumping sites which is very close in peoples houses, we do not have WATER few taps are working and we have  water pipe busted we reported that mater to Mr Robert Samuels IN kUILSRIVER but he didn't even attended to the matter ,and we do not have Electricity we have unlegal connections which is causing the driftsands formal houses to suffer n eskom comes everyday to fix the the damage that We are causes, we went to eskom to ask for the electricity we brought a letter ID copies of members of the area we were told to go to city of cape town ,we  communicated with Mr Samuel  in kuilsriver he told us that we wont get electricity  cos we are are in wet area .we went in Civic centre to lay complaint about the service delivery.till today still nothing has ever happened. eversince we ha voted  in 2016 our so called  counsillor havent done anything for us .we have been communicating about this matter but with no luck . so this our last resort now }{We are situated in Joostenbergvlakte Kraaifontein and the City is wasting money on getting the road tar but 2 months later its back to normal cause the contractors only spray black tar over the gravel and then after a month or 2  its back to normal. Unfortunately I can't load pictures on here so that people can see how the City is wasting our money on so called service delivery.  }{I received invoices amounting to more than R30 000 from the City Electricity generation. letters mentions tempared or defective electricity meters. 
In june they told me they have to change the meters because they are old. A month later i started getting invoices demanding that i pay for defective meters. Everytime i call i get a different response/ reason to the demand.
reasons are something like this
1. Meters were changed in all old houses. (i know its a lie because they didnt change for my white neighbors houses. )
2. Because meters are old, they read less units and i end up using more electricity than what i'm paying for. so the city did a calculation and now they expect me to pay all that electricity that the meter was not reading properly for the past 10 years. but i have been staying here for 6 years only. also why is it my problem to pay for something that i didnt cause? it is not my responsibnility to service electricity meters. 
3. They claim to have found red tape inside the meter, and they think it is not from the municipality, that means i once opened the box. But funny they didnt show this to us when they came to replace the meter, also they found the meter box still locked as per normal. also what proof do they have that it is temparing. and what benefits did i gain from the temparing ? 

currently they managed to load this amount in my electricity account, therefore each time we buy electricity they deduct 50% of the funds and i get electricity for 50% of the funds. We are already struggling to make ends meet needs, now being punished for something we have no idea about. Something we didnt cause and without agreement it is really unfair. 
this city is not just racist but they attack black residents making life so difficult that we end up not affording to live here. that is the only conclusion i can come up with. I have been calling, email asking for a meeting with the electricity officials but they refuse. I opened an investigation with ombudsman department but no difference. They also keep on promising to get back to me, but they never do. This is just a scheme but DA to make money and chase the blacks out of Cape Town. }{<div>&nbsp;I would like to thank Officer Fourie and his partner&nbsp; from Law enforcement who was driving from Rooiels towards the Strand on Sunday Afternoon 24th&nbsp; Nov</div><div><br><br></div><div>We were out on our Motorbike and stopped along the side to enjoy the view.

I was under the impression that it was illegal to do so I believed that they have to use a restrictor to slow the flow the water. Free water is spewed across the land and it lies upon the poor rate paying citizens to foot the bill. Yet when we default the water gets disconnected completely. This goes against the constitution. Why do we have to tote the line when the municipality uses criminal activities to extort unusually high tariffs from us? Maybe its because we wont strike? Maybe not yet? Maybe because we cant afford to sit without services? Who knows? Unconstitutional actions need to be reported and I for one would love to know if there is even a vehicle to address there injustices.  }{I have called the City of Cape Town **********with a motor vehicle query. 
The person answering my call was not able to answer my query and ask me to hold on and then discontinued the call. 
When I called back, I told the next person that answered what had happened and explain to her my query. She also just discontinued the call. 
When I called back and ask to speak to the supervisor on duty my call was dropped. I called back about 8 times and as soon as someone picked up the call not sure if they could see my number cause they continued dropping the call and I eventually gave up as I realise that the City of Cape Town  don't care about our coloured people we only good to keep the ANC out of the Western Cape and not to attend to any of our queries. 
To sad to see that people in places such as Wesbank and Mitchells Plain still vote for the DA }{After owning a property in Cape Town for 23 years the city now refuses to give me relevant bills to may property managing agent because they have decided to get clever 23 years after the fact and insist on the company registration number. the company that owns the property was changed from a CC to Pty and they have the old registration number on record but the new company registration number was changed. We are getting a ridiculous run around from them to the point where I would rather sell up my property and invest in Natal where the council doesn't harass regular paying citizens with incompetence}{City of Cape town very ridiculous service delivery. Have to wait 4 days now without water,after reconnections was sent to be done . Was also escalted at superiors at the depo but still no feedback from you guys after numerous calls and idiot call centre agents that is incompetent to do there job.How do you expect people to stay without water.you are so quick to disconnect but unable to put it back on quick suppose to be 48hrs sla agreement bull****.}{For 3 weeks now I've been attempting to get an infestation of bees removed from my city of cape town owned flat in Parow. I went to the local office and each time I get told it's been logged but never receive a reference number even. I am looking after a parent who is elderly and disabled who is allergic to bee stings. But even with that being known to them, still no action. Are they waiting until somebody dies of a bees sting? Because it's a possibility!

Apart from that, I live on the ground floor of my building and have reported a huge crack in my kitchen ceiling. With 2 levels above me, when my inconsiderate hooligan neighbors above does their laundry, it leaks through the huge crack and I have to switch off my electricity as it is a shock hazard. This has been reported more than 2 years ago! 2 months back, my mother slipped in the kitchen due to this issue and she broke her ankle! As a diabetic and already partially disabled pensioner, she had to be hospitalized for more than a month. Who's going to have to pay the hospital bills?  When are they going to do something about it? When the building collapses on me & my family?

My building is called Arena Court. It has become an absolute **** hole with rubbish strewn everywhere. No maintenance or upkeep of the flat at all. They don't even water the grass, which is now officially a sand pit! It's not like we stay there for free either. It has honestly become so dangerous to live here with the bee situation, drug addicts operating 24 hrs a day and the added health risk of all the rubbish around.

In an incident this weekend, my hooligan neighbors above me had yet another violent episode. Swearing, breaking windows and yes, someone was stabbed multiple times. Out of concern for myself and my parent, I called the Police! I am still waiting on them, and it's Monday again!

I'm at my wits end. If I had the money to buy or build a house of my own, I would vacate this premises in a heartbeat!

So disappointed with the lack of urgency from the council. I will have to pay a visit to the Ombudsman}{I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and sincere appreciation to Natasha at the Strand Municipality.  I went to the municipality on 6 November 2019 to renew my motor vehicle registration.  She was friendly and very professional, although it was almost closing time.  When I wanted to pay, I found that there was no money in my bank account and I asked her if I could quickly go to my car to transfer money on my cellphone.  When I came back, the office was closed and security opened the door when I told them that my form is already inside and I just have to pay.  Natasha was still waiting me.  She did not close her blinds, but were sitting and waiting for me.
I was so taken aback - service that exceeds all expectations!  What a star!  Look after her - her kind is spread very thinly.}{I applied for my car's license disk online, two weeks back, I havent received my disk nor did I receive any communication on when I will get it. Service request **********}{My garbage was not collected and I logged a call that same day - Thursday.
I called back the Friday and I was told adamantly I must be patient, the turnaround time is 48 hours, fully knowing that Saturday is 48 hours and the only collect commercial waste then.
I escalated the call on Sunday, called twice on Monday, called again on Tuesday and also on Wednesday.
The lady who does the escalation (Michelle) promised everyday she will call me first thing in the morning, but I had to call her on Tue and Wed.
Today again (Wed), the CC agent said that I am on her list to call me, but still no call from Michelle. I called some extra council help from my own town, but also no help there.
I also said I am not going to pay and they said it cannot be done. 
So tomorrow my waste will be collected officially, while missing an entire week and paying for it. I spent almost 2 hours on the phone for nothing, don't know what I was expecting.
What a wonderful country!

He logged that a disabled pensioner requires his legal trickle of water.
He sounded very nice on phone and extremely helpful.
Pensioner was told it would take 24-48 hours.

Monday 04.10.19 /11h53- NO TRICKLE yet, which is against this person's constitutional right.
Spoke to Andiswa.
Apparently, although Ref. No. correct, it was not logged. Thank you gavin brookes.

Andiswa attempted to give this pensioner another Ref. No. , which pensioner refused to accept. Had same been accepted, it would give COCT another +48 hours to give pensioner, his trickle of water.
 
Andiswa apparently spoke to her Team Leader, who had the following to say:
All old meters no longer have the ability, to give a trickle of water.
That the law is incorrect. Only meters with blue lids, can now give a trickle. 

Honestly, we ask you, with tears in all our eyes, what absolute drivel.

This pensioner might be disabled but, his sharp brain, has never been questioned.

I had to call again today no manager called spoke to samkelo and Nqaba and Finally the conclusion is that its no longer 21 days, but 30 working days.

Also advised that due to financial constraint would only be able to pay an extra amt of R500. Towards my arrears as from the 27/06/19, I acknowledge the outstanding amt and am also prepared to sign an acknowledgement of debt, am also prepared to bring them the copies of the stop orders which was put in place for R1250, from 27 May and and extra R500 from the 27 June. They refused to put this in place as my bank statements, bank statements and pays lips were required. 

The 5/8//19 my water was disconnected, unfortunately I can't pay the full arrears in one full pmt due to financial constraint. 

I went bck to make arrangements on the 21/06/19 spoke to Miss Botha-and 21/08/19 spoke with Mr Bruintjies-once again advised I acknowledge the outstanding debt, stop order in place for R1250.00 and increased the extra R500 to R750.and still they refused to make me sign the docs without my bank statements, pays lip, etc. 

There service sucks-and due to there lack of understanding, compassion and Incompetence, a lot of money will be lost by the municipalities. 

I give them a 2 star rating
}{We have had a sewer drain that blocks every so often. Every time this has been reported, a team has arrived to unblock it, sometimes within minutes. Even over the weekend, after hours, an hour later and the team is on site. Eventually this weekend they worked out the pipe outside the property had broken and arrived today to replace it. A **** job if I may say. After identifying where the problem was they proceeded to dig a trench about 5m long and ended up about 1.5m deep. The pipe was replaced and the area left neat, clean and tidy all on the same day. Well done!}{I have phoned smsed emailed ward councillors of the area no help.
I have 5 reference numbers and they still cant help.
2 weeks ago they protested in the road where I live in Philippi and burnt down the electric poles, I have school going kids and a baby and a old woman in the house and we have no power, all our food stuff went off in freezer and now we spending 3 times as much money buying food daily. they sent someone out and they said that they cant help as they only work with pre paid meters.
they also said that this job will take months before someone who does this kind of work comes out.

really now this is really unprofessional now even the people in the call centre cant help as they just put phone down. Im tired now of phoning and that that's is why I have brought it top Hello Peter}{This has been a very long week for me and it's all thanks to the City of Cape Town and their incompetent staff, sorry to say.
I had reported a faulty water meter that caused water supply into my house to be cut off. I have been following up, letting them know every time that I have no water in the house.
Yesterday they come fix the leak and leave without supplying water into the house. Unfortunately I'm told I have to wait again for about 48 hours. One their staff hung up on me when I said I wanted to speak to someone superior. Her name is Amanda. I'm very frustrated and disappointed if this is how the city treats people. How is it to have no water in your house for 4 days? Ask me, I now know.}{I called into the contact center on Saturday the 03.08.2019 to report two light poles that is not working in my street (Metern Crescent Dennemere Blackheath Western Cape). Which i thought will be a quick call turned out to be a nightmare when i was first struggling to get through to an agent and when I eventually came through to someone I was assisted by the  most incompetent agent i have ever dealt with (Lynette). After explaining my query, Lynette told me she cannot assist as her system was offline and I will need to call back before 14:00pm as this is there closing time. I informed Lynette why cant she just take all the details and log the request when the system is back up and her response was they an inbound call center and when she put the down another call will come through which i understand. I asked her if she does not have a function to go on not ready to avoid calls from coming in to lodge the query when the system is up and running, which she  responded no. I then asked her to take down the details and give it to her Team leader to once the system is online as i do not see why i should call back again. She rudely responded by saying you do not have to call back if you don't want to. This statement made me so angry i immediately requested her to put her team leader on the line and was placed on mute till the call got disconnected. Determined to get the query sorted i call back and got through to the same agent again and requested her to put me through to her team leader again which is Mr Jacobs according to the agent. After holding the line she came back and advised me her team leader  is on another call and will call me back (which i can understand why he is on another as your staff creates irate customers , seems they do not want to work on a weekend). I received 2 calls later the afternoon which i assume is from Mr Jacobs,however both these calls was silent. I kept on greeting and no response. This is my first experience with the City of Cape Town call center and the service received was really pathetic and unacceptable. Your agents are unwilling to assist and lack pro-activeness. Looking at other reviews about your contract center staff this seems to be a trend and looks like nothing is being done....}{I am so disappointed in the City of Cape Town services. I took ownership of a property in July 2018. Ever since that time I have had issues with my water billing , which has been estimated since last year when I moved in. I have informed them about the situation and they came out to read my water meter and said its faulty. They informed us that the water would be replaced and up until today nothing happened. I have been to the sub council offices more then 20 times already and every time they just have excuses. Either they don't have water meters in place some other lame excuses. I have been making payments every month ever since I moved into this property however my bill is almost at R10 000 a year later. To top it off I received a lawyers letter stating I need to settle my account immediately or the will garnish it of my salary. City of Cape Town your services is pathetic , yet the people in council owned properties and informal settlements don't pay a cent. Seems like we that are private owners need to pay for them as well.}{Dear City of Cape Town

I am finding it really hard to  find the words to compile a message not *****ed by pure  disappointment and anger.

I have logged a faulty water meter (diagnosis made by a private professional & our ward counsellor) on Thursday the 25th of July 2019. This faulty water meter has resulted in NO WATER! I have made numerous phone calls, emails, and promises of it being escalated has been made, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I am now entering the 6th day  (144hours) with no water coming from my taps.

I am normally a very patient individual with regards to service delivery type situations as I understand the pressure you as a municipality is under. My empathy cup is now rather a bit depleted. I kindly wish that you see this and be proactive or at least communicate and give timelines. The 144 hours with no water is now infringing on the consumer rights act, as it is an installed, active and paid for service by me, the consumer.

Please do not ***** my love for this city any further.

Warm regards.

What made this worthy of a complement is his good, helpful attitude and interest in assisting me.  I got there at the point where they had just packed up, but he still gave me a form, took the added time to wait for me to fill it in, and still found the time to quickly explain how to use it.  Thanks Mark}{Good Afternoon, I bought electricity on 1st July 2019, which I only received 17units for r40 without any free units.
I find this very strange as we always monitor our electricity usage to not exceed the 450units a month.
We do everything to safe electricity, using a flask if we boiled a kettle water. Putting the geyser off. If we not in one of the rooms at night we don't switch the light on. 
Now why on earth do we have to pay so a lot of money per unit.
Also our house value is less then r400 000. 
I did call but the waiting period way too long. }{Power outages were happening all over cpt due to the bad weather, tried contacting call centre to get help on why only our block of property was out but the surrounding areas power was still on, there are like only 8 houses on this block where as residents in the same street had power. On the call the had a list of streets with power outages but our street was not listed so I needed to inform them. After staying on hold for the past 30 minutes someone answers the phone but there is no communication (could hear the background call centre operators talking). I'm trying to get their attention but constantly asking for help but no one is still answering. This goes on for more than 10 minutes (that's why the hold line is so long) and eventually I hear someone pick up the phone, only to put the phone down. This call was placed 22/06/2019 at 10h22, and I've been in queue till around 10h56, and the operator put the phone down at around 11h00, those heavy dense pieces of ****.}{We recently had a new electricity meter installed by City of Cape Town and when I bought electricity this morning, I bought it on the old meter number by mistake. I phoned City of Cape Town to transfer the token to the new number. However they were SO pathetic and unhelpful!! I spoke to Sibongile (2019.06.08 @ 12:29) who was so rude and unprofessional (zero phone etiquette!) and first told me there's nothing I can do about it; then asked how much electricity I bought and subsequently said I have to go to their offices to sort it out and that it will cost me R500 to transfer the token to the new meter. How ridiculous!!! When I asked to speak to someone else, she asked why I wanted to speak to someone else, and when I asked to speak to her manager she said I have to phone back on Monday! How is this person even allowed to deal with clients?? She has no clue about client service.
Also, why could City of Cape Town not simply transfer the token to my new meter? It's really not a complicated matter!
Please note that I subsequently contacted Prepaid24 (thank goodness I make use of their services) who sorted it out for me immediately and I received the transferred  token within 5 minutes. No fuss. Incredible service from Prepaid24! Terrible NON-service from City of Cape Town's call center staff............!!!!!}{
My mother Rayda Mohammed desperately need your help. I’m writing to you on behalf of my mother, who is a pensioner in Woodstock. 
She had a neighbor dispute with a German company Greenability pty Ltd which has moved into a commercial building next to her house, she had various complaints regarding the use of the servitude next to the house which belongs to my mother. Which the neighbor has right if way over my mom’s land, As a pensioner they tried to bully her to sell and overstepped their boundary by digging up to lay cables and use my mom’s house as their boundary, placing electric fencing on my mothers property.
She gave them several warnings, eventually I stepped in as her son to help her protect her property, we applied to council to put up a boundary wall, which was approved. The company then took my mom to court and as my mother is a pensioner, I had to help pay the bill.
We have just got a judgement on Friday and my mom lost the case against the company, even though the council approved the plans. We now have to pay for the lawyers costs over R100 000 and court application for both parties, which is a huge strain on us.
I’m contacting you to ask if you could help in any way, to help my mom who’s a pensioner in Woodstock appeal this case or to advise what her options are. The council should be paying half but they not coming forward, if it was not for council approval of the wall we would not be in this position, my mother did everything through council, should the city of capetown not be responsible for bill of cost, as they approved the wall for a pensioner, it’s a very stressful time for my 76 year old mother. 

Please advise if you possibly can

Kind regards

17 Cornwall street Woodstock}{I moved into the Breakers in August (8 months ago!) and was told there was fibre "in the building". Turns out they had set up the infrastructure internally but hadn't connected it to main grid yet (which literally involves one day of work to dig it in across the road). I have gone back and forth endlessly with Afrihost (my ISP) and SADV (the fibre company) and the approval from City of Cape Town is dragging on and on. This from someone I finally managed to track down at SADV responsible for the project on their side:

"The city of cape Town advised that there are other providers Telkom I'm guessing that has an open Wayleave in the whole of hout bay and we need there approval before we given the Wayleave permit"

I work from home so I need internet and signed up for a substandard temporary capped wireless router as I thought I would only need it for a few weeks and its now been 9 months! At my wits end with it and it is affecting my business.

What does it take for the to get this approval through??}{On Friday 17 May municipal workers wanted access to my garden to look for a manhole. I told them that there was none and I have lived here for 43 years. Then they insisted that there was a sewerage pipe which was supposedly blocked. I told them that sewerage does not run uphill. On Monday 20 May it rained but early Tuesday morning they were here with a subcontractor insisting that his six men dig for the "blocked pipe". After 5 hours of digging, cutting off major roots of my 40 year old yellow wood tree and creating a hole of about 2m x 1m x 1m they found a pipe which was capped 1 m into my property (installed but unused pipe). This caused them to look for the problem elsewhere. They found it downhill from me it and cleared the blockage in a very short time.}{I requested a replacement water meter almost a year ago (which i regret), and since then we've had endless disruptions in water supply. I've sent through complaints via every channel imaginable for the last year, and i spent countless hours on the phone reporting water outages, with today being the most recent. The only thing i didn't try was to hand deliver a written complaint to the Mayor's office, and drag every lazy person to the property to experience this first hand. 
All that happens is that i get another reference number. The only time there is water daily is between 10:30 and 16:30. The water is off now as we speak. The service level and urgency from the City has really been appalling and ridiculous. No one wants to own the issue, everyone just passing the buck. If a service provider (i.e. Ikapa) is not delivering, fire them.
The last resort was to lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman, and I was really hoping to get a better response from them. Today after 3 months i received an email from the Ombudsman's office - But all they've done is to send me to another department. We've gone through hell to try and resolve this (and still do), and this was their best effort? The latest ref number is  ********** 026. Where do i go to next, court?

Since when service delivery is carried around ? why must we suffer as people.they said I must fill a form and they will give me a call as soon as  they are signed.5 days later no call and I went there again  today (2019-05-15) only to find the office closed at 8:00 ,9:00 oclock two interns arrived and they told me to come back later as they have no keys and I refused cause what is that ?Its barbaric.I needed a proof of address for a job application and I wasted a whole day that I could have been at work as the office only opened at  12 :00 only because they saw that I am not leaving and I took pictures of them as they were busy doing their hair.I mean we voted last week,Is this the service we were voting for.After waiting for 4 hours they refused to give me 2 forms/proof of address.}{I have logged a complaint regarding a toilet replacement on my property which had been logged over two weeks ago, I have spoken to the city manager as well she has been very helpful in liasing with me, but nobody came to fix it, the toilet is broken

Whenever I call the call centre, they're still waiting on feedback.

This is the worst service that I have ever received.}{We have a vagrant problem in our area with vagrants using drugs, loitering, trespassing, littering and defecating on our properties.  This has been going on for a few years now and after numerous complains and reporting this to the City of Cape Town and the SAPS, I am still looking outside with vagrants trespassing on our property, sleeping and defecating on my property, stealing copper from my property, making noise, fighting, littering, using drugs and drinking. This has been reported so many times that we have simply stopped wasting our time reporting it and keeping track off references. The problem is not being addressed and we get no backing from the local law enforcement, nor from the SAPS, the SAPS doesn't even pitch up when called. 

I would like to get in contact with the authorities that are supposed to be assisting my community yet going through the normal channels have been yielding no results for years now. Our community is fed up with our properties being vandalized and damaged, and we are fed up with cleaning up faeces, bottles and litter every day because no one helps us to address the problem. Our houses are being stripped of anything that has value, no one is helping us at all.

We are fed up.}{Have a Prepaid meter in and use prepaid power, lately  the City of Cape Town Charge  now over a year on the water en Electricity account also  a extra amount for Prepaid power .

I have had 6 instances of sewage flooding my back yard in this year alone. It is so incredibly stink, and a  health hazard for my child, pets and myself. Everytime they come and sprinkle something and everytime is ''solves'' the issue for about a week. I have had 4 incidents of flooding in April 2019 alone! I am at the point where I now need to move, but who will buy this house! It seems as if the City of Cape Town promises but fails to deliver.   How is it impossible to solve this and how can they tolerate paying citizen to live in these conditions!}{I hired the Wittebome Civic centre for a funeral. I paid upfront for 4 hours at R200 per hour and a Deposit of R1200.. This was mid-March 2019. To this day I have still not received my Deposit back!! I left that place spotless clean, not a broken chair..packed all the chairs away with the help of my kids. Washed all surfaces, swept floors. It was for a Funeral..Just 4 hours!
 Why cant they refund our Deposits more timeously?? I will Never recommend hiring these Civic centres to anybody for any kind of function with this lackadaisical attitude of their staff!}{This rating is in regards to the services rendered by the parking attendants. The parking solution of the City was great, but there is a new tendency that I picked up under a lot of the attendants. They do not attend to motorists who have parked, but some stand around chatting to the public, while others run after vehicles getting them parking while you have to wait until the attendant decides it is your turn.  They literally stand next to your vehicle and when you get out to pay, they run off in another direction. It is infuriating.  Another tendency that I have noticed is that they do not give you change, but simply accepts that the change is their due. I do not want to make an issue of it, but I wonder how much they manage to pilfer this way. It should be addressed by management. Thank you to the attendants who are helpful and friendly.}{I have had just about enough of the city municipal accounts - I'm a paying citizen month after month, just over a year ago I logged a issue regarding a leak at the meter the water from the meter started running down the road bearing in mind this was during the peak of water shortage! I received a reference number as per norm, a month later same issue occurred they would close the incident and mark it as resolved. This issue carried on for an additional 8 months we then received an outrageous bill of more than 40k by this time it was escalated and still no attention given. I then managed to get someone in the city of cape Town to escalate this matter with 11 reference numbers to go with it. We then had the infamous bakkie no. 6 that instructed to please watch and record as they will ensure this is resolved. They knocked up the pavement at the meter and encounter a leak a the meter the water was gushing out not even making it to the stop cork that feeds the property with municipal water. At this time our bill was climbing the ladder at 42k, being the person I am I still pay my acc month after month as per my normal payment bearing in mind at this time we have been penilised on our electricity penalties had been added to our municipal account. I can't believe how camly I'm typing this out as there is not enough English words to explain how disgusted I am as I called the accounts department several times after the leakage has been attended too they told me that they can see that there's an adjustment that's going to be made the people is working on my account same story month after month, only to come home tonight to no water. No notification. No contacting. No warning, just NO WATER......... I have had enough and will expose them across all media platforms possible. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!}{On Saturday 06th April I was driving in Khayelitsha Govan Mbeki drive in Town two facing Makhaza. Right on the robots I received a call and as law abiding citizen that I am I pulled off on the bus stop to attend the call. In front of me about 15 meters away from where I stood there were people who cleaning the streets with green reflectors working. One lady came to me and asked not to park there because they are cleaning and I nicely told her that ok I will be leaving soon am just taking the call am busy with and I went back to that call. Instead of leaving me alone she stood in my window while am busy talking on my phone and I stopped again and asked her to give me privacy, she told me right there that she wouldn’t, because she needs to clean therefore its either I move or get out of my car so she can remove the car for me, in a very aggressive tone.
I went back to my call and the person I was talking to suggested that we cancel the call and we did. Now I got back to her and ask why is she rude and remember she has not moved an inch away from my window and car, there was an exchange of words until I asked her to move away from my window and by that time she was pointing me through the window and poking me on my face, she didn’t move and now I have decided to get out of the car and because she standing against my door I had to push her and guess what, she pushed me back banging my door. Her colleagues came trying to pull her away from the car then I walked out and ask if they can give me the number of their manager and am willing stand there the whole day cancelling everything planned for the day and wanted to report that incident instantly. She was taken to some shack trying to calm her down but she came out of that shack with a knife running straight to me and I ran crossing the busy car road to a salon opposite for safety and she ran after me and tried to get in but the owner of the salon stopped her. She was so angry and she screaming, crying, insulting me, calling names and she walked back to my car and picked up stones , one to my back seat window and went to my windscreen and bust it and ended up stabbing my bonnet. At some point she was taken away.

I would love for some attention for City of Cape Town for a bad experience from their employee, for my medical bill for trauma counselling , and compensation for my vandalized car (Windscreen , bonnet ).}{COCT does not want to credit my mun acc when they over charged me for R 130,44. They said my electricity ''home user charge'' cannot be reversed. The problem that I have is that if this happens to say, 1000 households, COCT will pocket over R130K. To me this is unethical and unacceptable.}{Last year with the water crisis was working as an intern at the Municipality. We were well aware of all the water restrictions and what would and could happen if you used more than your fare share given daily.

Our household has 6 people so we applied for extra water and all was well until the stop tap started leaking we reported this and were told because its on the stop tap we were not going to be penalised.

Well this was a lie not long after that  our meter was replaced by the Water Management Device and now we have to pay for it.

This was discussed with us it was just come and put in. Our Bill was very high and it was not even completely written off even though it was not a fault however we considered it fine as long as we dont recieve the WDMS. 

But now the device is put in and we have to pay a bill that was not our fault as well as a device we were told we would not get because the leak was not our fault.}{After numerous attempts to try and get hold of them,To ask about my account that is repeatable incorrectly charged and each time /month I call they said they will fix.

I am also posting this all over social media. This is unacceptable!!!!}{Irregular costs on Water bill,You have to call them every month yet they never fix anything.I have been charged vacant even charge for a year yet I have a water meter.I have been charged for 2 meters.}{I hope that someone could help us by this review. I live in Ocean View in a municipality flat for years. Through the years we have maintained our flat out of our own pockets and did not complain about it. We as a family decided enough is enough. We have laid complaints and concerns at our housing office, numerous times and yet no reply. Our neighbour above us had water problems in their bathroom which lead to the water leaking through to our side. It left a hole in our sealing and now waste water is dripping everytime. Its a new year and yet.. Nothing!!! We had our own taps, the council installed new taps and now we sitting with problems. They tiled around our bath.. Incomplete. Our rent is close to R1000pm and no maintenance are being done to our flat. Window frames are breaking, walls are cracked and yet no one came out to check. So here's my question: Why are we paying so much rent and no maintenance? When they do send people out, the work always ends incomplete and on top of it, our property gets damaged and we still have to fix it out of our pockets. There are so many unemployed people that could get the jobs done or sort out your sloppy employees especially the ones at our housing officers.}{I live in Somerset West and we need to  deal with the City of Cape Town Municipality unfortunately. We log a request last year Aug -(early) Sep 2018 to fix the glass panel on our water meter to be able to read the water readings 100%. So far the City of Cape Town Municipality  has done nothing. When you phone them, they say they can see the call is open and no one re-acted on that yet. They say we need to phone them everyday to ask them to come out and fix the meter, maybe someone will eventually act on that. We do not have the time to phone them everyday.... My "Ziller" is right we need to withdraw our tax money. Why do we tolerate this service anymore.... how long does it take for the City of Cape Town Municipality to respond to requests?}{Ever since I got an account with the city of cape town in October 2018, I never had joy at all.  I am complaining every month.  I just received a statement with incorrect information. When I send emails they ignore them. They respond once and when I make a follow up on their responses they decide not to reply. I am really not satisfied with their accounts department. To get things sorted I always have to go to the municipal office. The contact centre also does not get it every time I call them.  The service of the account department is very poor and I am hoping that this will give them  a wake up call.}{My folks had a faulty water meter.

I phoned the city of Cape Town customer number for the last 3 days 3 times a day without any luck.  The first time I called, they told me that the maximum turnaround time is 48h. It has been 48h already no one contacted me. I phoned again after the 48h. They told me that they will escalate my request again and that I have to wait 48h again. This is unacceptable as I have children that have to bath I have to prepare food ect. The city of Cape Town is only interested in our money without delivering on our basic essential needs. This is disgusting service. In addition, the worst part is there is no authority that I can lodge a complaint with except the city ombudsman witch will take up to 3 months.  Some government workers just don’t care about the normal people as they have a attitude that their salary is guaranteed doesn’t matter how bad they treat normal Tax payers}{I got married in Somerset West hall on the 8th of December,a friend who was our wedding planner did most of these arrangements,every payment we would submit our receipts as proof of payment..and we were promised that the refund of R1130 will be paid back to  us in three full as per turn around time and after four weeks I sent an email to the administration inquiring about the delay I made phone calls and people who were busy will our processing were acting of sick we finally got the feedback after few days and we were told that we owed R307 that's why it delayed this was shocking to hear but I gave them a go ahead to deduct it on the refund amount three week passed the new story is that the person is on leave who was busy with my refund and to my mind I got shocked.busy with the refund??? How long does it take..my contract states that the refund will be paid within 3 week I am very angry with this treatment and poor service that we are receiving and sick and tired of the lies..as little as it is it's my money and I will go further that this}{City of Cape town has one of the worst services any human can Imagine, I requested a septic tank cleaning truck and they said it will take about 5 days , I made a request and I have a  reference number for it on the 23rd of Jan 2018, today is 5th pf feb 2018 and still nothing. Its difficult to live in house with kids under these circumstances . My ref  ********** 764}{I have a water bill that went up to R27000 in one month. I was told to pay R1500 last year in Sept 2018 so they can do meter testing. Although l went and made the payment, Up until now they have not done the meter testing and the bill is now above R30000. Why won't they do meter testing??? The bill is  ridiculous because only one person stayed in the house at that time. They are dragging to resolve the matter because they know it's their fault. It is so frustrating..... Daylight robbery by cct....... Any person with a normal brain would understand that something must have gone wrong with their calculations to come up with such a bill. I have involved lawyers but they also not helping, all they are doing is spending my money. Ombuds also didnt respond to my complain. I'm extremely frusyed with this bill.}{Our water is off. Why? Because, after I held for 18 minutes, I speak to a consultant who tells me their new blue meters reset end of month and sometimes have an error. But “it will be fine by 4am”. Now, 24 hours later without a drop of water at home, and on my third call, I am told they have a 48 hour service level with their contractors and can do nothing until that time has expired. So, the City seems cool with consumers going completely dry due to fault of their equipment? Maybe we need some new government in the Cape soon....}{During December 2018 me and my family went to Mnandi Beach. I have never been to any beach where I saw cleaner toilets. I am talking about the once at the end of the parking area by the open beach side. My compliments to your attendants for doing a sterling job.}{City Of Cape Town Municipality has really upgraded the standards and the way they treat customers a big thank you.}{On 7 Jan I reported a water leak on behalf of my aged mom.  As her property has a gate (unlocked) which baffles the water meter reader regarding access, we asked if they could move the reader to outside of the property.  My mom and i had previously requested this on 6 separate occasions to no avail.  Since no one attended to the leak i took my mom through to City of Cape Town municipality where the consultant relogged the request however suggested we get a plumber to fix the problem and send the paid bill to City of Cape Town for a refund.  We phoned again on 14 Jan to say no one has attended to the leak or the moving of the meter.  It is now 22 Jan and no one has attended to the leak or the moving of the meter.
 It is shocking service delivery}{Purchased electricity from SPAR, Uitzicht on 17 November 2018 for R850-00 and received 438,20 units.
Purchased electricity from SPAT, Uitzicht on 18 December 2018 for R850-00 and received 401,00 units, difference of 37,20 units.
Logged onto the Municipal website (Electricity Complaints) more than two weeks ago, with NO RESPONSE to date.
This is how the City serves it citizens !!!!!!!!}{Very impressed. After some initial difficulty with registering for on-line payment of vehicle licence and other municipal services, it was successful. The greatest surprise however was when my license disk arrived in the post. Exactly 8 working days after payment, as was promised. Thank you City of Cape Town and René Kay!}{We complain about sewer from 2017 and now is worse, we spend Christmas and New Year day with human faeces in front of our houses, we reported but no one care, the tar also explodes because the manholes are worn and there is human faeces overflowing every where,}{I logged a service request for no street lights in Islander Close, Pine Acres, Gordon's Bay in November 2018.  Unfortunately I did not keep record of the reference number.  I have since brought this to the attention of Helen Zille and the City of Cape Town on Twitter on numerous occasions.  However, I was, once again, informed by the CoCT that the body corporate is responsible for street lighting.  I have the same issue every time I report that the street light is not working - they tell me that the body corporate has to take care of it.  Every single time I have to EXPLAIN AGAIN THAT THIS IS NOT A COMPLEX AND THERE IS NO BODY CORPORATE.  Every time it takes months of explaining that I pay rates and taxes to CoCT every month and that this area is the responsibility of the municipality.  What will it take for CoCT to get their ducks in a row so that I can get the service that I am paying for.}{City of Cape Town is disappointing. I logged a call on the 29/12/2018 still have no water.}{I've been living at the same address since 2007,paying the same account ( ********** 15) since I moved in,and never had an outstanding balance.About two months ago I discovered that someone at the municipality decided to close that account and send me a new account ( ********** 02) with an outstanding balance of around R48000-00.I've been trying to get this sorted out  since November but everytime I call there is a different excuse. I have been given the following refence no's  ********** 898 ,  ********** 289 ,  ********** 110 and yet again this morning  ********** 650.All the agent tells you is that the request was escalated but nothing gets done.Is this what "The City Works For You" mean. Nobody contacts you and keeps you up to date.It seems to me that the request is just passed on from one department to the next and I'm sitting in the middle.Is there anyone that can sort this out ????????????}{Since 2017 we have tried via proper channels to get a tree cut (Sent pics of hazard and homeless sleeping under the tree and using it as a toilet), but it seems nobody can assist you; even escalated my query to the mayor's office.

The tree is an outstanding issue since 2017; our water pipe has bursted at a couple of places already, but maintenance and restoration of the pavement seems not the be a priority.  I can't believe that a big organisation that has a slogan ;" THE CITY WORKS FOR YOU"..... Are you serious given the evidence that it is clearly not working ....

What must we do if we follow proper procedures and send emails, make calls, but nothing happens??? Who do we speak to??}{I was here on the 26th of November 2018 made my learners appointment at the traffic department in ottery old strandfontein .... The lady told me next week Thursday i will be writing my test. I came the following Thursday which is the 6th December 2018...only to find out my appointment was the Wednesday. I know i was suppose to check my receipt, but it was a honest mistake. They can atleast send people a reminder via text, i mean, now i have to pay again which is not fair( money making scheme) There were "no shows" in the test room and they wouldnt even fill people in. You are suppose to help us not get money out of us and the services here are the worst. Only one person assisting at 8 in the morning and the que is outside the gate.... They could of just given me another date but noe i have to pay again...... Very disappointed in this place and tgere service}{According to signs at the traffic department branch in Ottery, they close at 15:30. So with that in mind, I move heaven and earth to finish my work so  that I can make it on time. I arrive at 14:30 but struggled to find parking so I walk up to the "Helpdesk" (not much help offered here) at 14:40 only to be told that they don't take any more people after 14:30 - a whole hour before they are legally supposed to stop work!  So I ask one of the unhelpful ladies who is in charge and she tells me it''s the first female I spoke to so I ask who is in charge of her and am told that their supervisor is at a training session and will only be back - you guessed it - at 15:30. So I decided I would wait for him. I had resigned myself to the fact that I would not get my driver''s licence renewed that day but I would make my point.  Long story short, they have an internal arrangement to close early so they don't have to stay late meanwhile the public is under the impression that they have until 15:30. So you jump through hoops at your own place of work, rush through all kinds of obstacles to make it on time only to discover it's been for nothing! Surely this is not legal? I can't think of any institution which deals with the public where you can just take an hour of someone's time. And do these employees get paid an hour less of taxpayers' money as well. I would probably have been a bit more understanding had it not been for the attitude of entitled that accompanied this totally unacceptable arrangement.  Flies and honey....}{I would just like to commend The City of Cape Town for their excellent service delivered.  I reported a fused street light, potholes in our area and incomplete municipal work and they not only completed the above in record time but also in a proper and neat fashion.  Further the admin response was top class and I feel that those employees should be commended for their excellent service.  Much appreciated!!!!

Never got an answer on many email requests, it seems there is no one working anymore at the city services or they just ignore everyone. On the profile it says "in process". Last year it was the same, I got fines because I never got the license. I had to pick it up myself.  So why do they offer online service for vehicle registration?}{What is the issue with water pressure in Goodwood (RIchmond Estate)? We are not receiving any feedback on our calls that we have logged. We tried phoning this morning and gave up after holding for almost an hour - from two different phones. (not to mention the attitude from the call centre when they do answer - yup, I'm speaking of Stefan the call centre "supervisor" also) We just get the same script about "pressure management" and "we will get back to you", but no one ever does.. Can we please AT THE LEAST get an honest answer as to what the issue is and when it will be resolved in order for us to plan around living without water?

What is the issue with water pressure in Goodwood (RIchmond Estate)? We are not receiving any feedback on our calls that we have logged. We tried phoning this morning and gave up after holding for almost an hour - from two different phones. (not to mention the attitude from the call centre when they do answer - yup, I'm speaking of Stefan the call centre "supervisor" also) We just get the same script about "pressure management" and "we will get back to you", but no one ever does.. Can we please AT THE LEAST get an honest answer as to what the issue is and when it will be resolved in order for us to plan around living without water?

I am filthy dirty due to your incompetence. I haven't been able to do laundry, brush my teeth or go to work on a regular basis due to your sporadic changes in water pressure management. We have logged calls upon calls asking to assist but nothing gets done except for opening the cover of of out water meter and then leaving.

I phoned the water department at 8:00 this morning, as stated on their website, (they only answered at 09:00, Stephan informed me that they open at 07:00 meaning their web info is wrong as well) wanting to enquire about not having any water AGAIN. I had to cancel a very important appointment due to incompetence. 

I have spoken to numerous people who live in the same area experiencing the same problem. 

I pay an astronomical amount for water every month and for what??}{I cannot put into words how appalled I am at the ridiculous behaviour and attendance to what the council calls matter of urgency. We have been without water for two whole entire days due to the incompetence of the council. Firstly this stupid meter they have installed for the second time shows that there are liters to be used but its not being directed to my home for some reason I log a complaint and the stupid plumber who comes out for them advises that we pay a private plumber to do the job and he breaks the fitting watches water squirt of of the meter and leaves....we still had no water and now the water is coming out of the meter..if it was just my husband and I it would probably be ok to wait but we have a baby on the bottle and 7 other people on our premises.i have gotten 3 ref # which the last was  ********** 322 and was advised by the last consultant Tarren advised the 24-48hr turn around time would have been passed by this afternoon and that if no one with a laptop shows up that I should call again. The last two days I have spent 600 rand airtime on calling ****ing fools who cannot do their jobs properly.. and still have no water. I have sent in complaits via sms, spoken to the unresponsive 
idiots on their WhatsApp group and now I cannot call and we still habe no ****ing water..the frustration i feel at this moment is beyond words. And the utterly disgusting manner in which this matter is being dealt with is putrid. I know and have been told that they work till 22h00 at night and i want this done today!!!No more damn excuses water is a necessity not a luxcury....come and get out water sorted!!!}{Since 20 June 2018, we have logged at least 8 calls to the CoCT due to raw sewerage pushing into our residential property. On each occasion a temporary fix is implemented by staff unblocking the blockage in the roads, but every time raw sewerage pushes out inside our property with no-one but us having to replace lawn and clean (despite water restrictions) the raw sewerage to ensure my dogs don't end up consuming it and my children don't have to play in raw sewerage. On 8 August we logged a request for a stop/reverse valve to be installed (ref no  ********** 760) but to date we had 3 more raw sewerage incidents and no feedback. Even Mr. Stuart Pringle was approached, but nothing resolved. We keep getting sent from pillar to post without resolution and having to incur costs at our expense. Surely this is a huge health risk for all tenants and animals in the area}{On 17 November 2017 I have reported to the City of Cape Town that the water reading on account number ( ********** 32) is incorrect.  After many e-mails I received confirmation on 27 June 2018 that this is indeed incorrect  (Meter reading 17kl  on 27/06/2016 - estimated reading on 4 December 2017 when I stopped paying the account 790kl).  Nearly 3 months later and no adjustment has been made.  At this stage we have paid for water that has not been used.  ITC has now sent a letter that we will be handed over for non payment.}{The City of Cape Town have forced me to replace my credit meter with a prepaid meter by threatening me.  If I opted not to take the prepaid meter then I would have to pay for a prepaid meter to be installed when my credit meter becomes faulty.  So I had not option.  They put the meter in but on the wrong, more expensive tariff.  So when I bought my first 600 units I didn't get 600 I got less.  So I complained.  So instead of them giving me the outstanding units they waited until I bought units the next month and then added the units to my token.  But I also bought only 600 units in this next month and because the outstanding units were added the system registered that I had bought more than 600 units and therefore charged me the higher rate for some of the units above  600.  Which is wrong.  Allan  De Jager from the municipality doesn't even understand how their own tariffs work.}{I am trying to figure out who the slogan "The City That Works For You" is  directed to. We logged a call on the 11th August for our 70 something year old neighbour,who has no water because of a damaged meter. A month later,the meter is still damaged, and we are still calling the City to get when they are coming. All to find out they have closed the service request that was logged. Who does this city work for exactly?  Was the call not a priority maybe, because the address is in Khayelitsha?}{Hi there. 
I want to write a review about the city of cape town municipality .
I am renting a granny flat with three other people and four in the main house.  Since they implemented the water restrictions form 50L per house hold we never receive water. We applied for an increase of water in April because the water is to little for all of us. We have made numinous phone calls to hear when are they coming to increase the water.  Four months has past by and still no one came. They were so quick to come and install the new meters but now that we have a problem they can't come and fix it. What is so frustrating is that the landlord went to the office in person twice but no still no response. We now at a point where we don't know what to do anymore.}{Hi, i have a couple of properties on my name. i always pay my rates and taxes on time,but March 2018 i have not received any invoices.
when i phone them they said my email address was wrong, which is very weird as i have been receiving my accounts on the same address for many many years. So someone on their side must have change my email address.
The only way to fix this is to sms your account nr and your email address, but i am still not getting any accounts.
eServices also do not work and just shows IN PROGRESS for the last year.
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO!!! the one account is over R11k. all i want to do is pay the money.
if you phone them you are listing to classical music for ages.}{In the last month the water has been off at our house for more than 16 days (it's only the 23rd today). We have had no water since Saturday. On Monday i reported the matter (the online numbers did not work over the weekend). I was assured it would take less than 48 hours for someone to come and check.  I waited patiently for 48 hours. When i reached the 48 hours yesterday i called through. And again 2 hours later and again 2 hours later. My fault is still listed as a level 1 fault which means they will send through a computer request for service. No follow up is required. It has now been explained to me that i will only move to a level 4 emergency after 120 hours when a single  email will be sent to  **********  CCT have explained the problem is with Aqualoc (although no-one has been to check what the problem is yet) .... but anyway being proactive i called Aqualoc in JHB, their head office, and was told they are NOT contractors for the CCT and will not be visiting my home.  I called the Ombudsman - sure they will respond to my email within 3 - 5 working days. REALLY???? Is this the best CCT can do???? Anyone HELP!!!!!!!!!}{Ref No:  ********** 867!!! Still nothing, this is the second time im putting you guys on Hellopeter!!! No one has came out to see why it is that I do not have water!!! This is pathetic!!! It can not take this long to have this issue sorted. The last time i waited about 12 hours max to have the metre battery changed and now this????

I NEED THIS SORTED BY TODAY!!!! I CAN NOT KEEP USING OTHER PEOPLES WATER!!!! IT IS WATER RESTRICTIONS YOU KNOW!

REALLY, REALLY FRUSTRATED!!!}{I am sitting without water for 7days, made the call on Tuesday and still no one has sorted the issue out! They have sent the request through to the driver and still nothing has happened! I have kids and I CAN NOT keep on using other peoples water as YOU GUYS DO NO ITS WATER RESTRICTIONS!!!! i NEED this sorted ASAP!!! It is getting really frustrating!!!!

Also, it looked as if someone was working at my meter (last week Thursday), the meter looks cracked and they have not covered up the sand around IT, not even the basic tar that is used, has been laid around it to protect it!!!!

PLEASE GET THIS SORTED!!!!}{I have called the City of Cape town on the 2018/08/06 21:36 reporting having no water supply,I was supplied with this reference  ********** 471.I decided to check it on their website only to find out It has the wrong address and I had to capture another request  ********** 253  as I do not understand how they will fix the problem without the right address.}{I have been receiving extremely high water bills, average R20000 per month since Feb 2018. Made numerous visits, and countless calls to the city to enquire this. All I could get out of them was they are investigating and will get back to me, which no response is received.  I had a private plumber, check for leaks and found none.  In April I requested the City to test the meter, as I suspected that to be the problem, which I had to pay them to remove and test.  Took them 2 months to test the meter, while the bill was escalating monthly. Finally end of June, it was found that the meter was faulty. To date I'm still awaiting my account to be credited. I'm now sitting with a water bill of R125,640  and once again numerous calls and visits to the City of Capetown, not one individual can give me an answer of when will this be resolved. Nobody from the City of Capetown gives customers feedback, numerous promises made but not kept by there staff members.}{After signing an affidavit saying I do not want a new water meter, the City of CT promptly installed one without informing me and are now expecting me to pay for it. R5000.  I have been to their Milnerton offices numerous times, emailed them over and over but they don't seem to understand how an affidavit works.  They keep asking me for proof of the affidavit and when I mail it them and explain it is lying at their office, they somehow do not understand. I keep getting mails and sms's saying I better pay??}{I just received my July 2018 Municipal account. With the new electricity and water tariffs, they have effectively increased my monthly bill with 26%. So no matter how little electricity or water I use, this is a permanent charge to my account and it will not go down.  How on earth can anyone justify adding 26% onto someone's monthly bill? This is ridiculous and I am extremely unhappy with the City for doing this and steamrolling over us ratepayers. The "reduction" in unit price of prepaid electricity is laughable. It does not cover the R150 levy that is now permanently attached to my monthly bill. For me to make up that monthly cost, I will have to use 81 units of electricity less in a month. I am not in a position to install solar panels or solar heater, so the City just assumes that everyone can afford these price hikes and make up their deficits from the public.  This was a rat-move, City of Cape Town. You should listen to your residents and not bully them!}{City plan poorly and now we must pay for their bad planning regarding water and electricity tariffs.  Like Eskom they are stealing us blindly.  Every month you will find additional costs on your account.  Over all everybody pay much more for water usage.  City can't come and tell they earn less money.  If they can't planned properly, we must vote for a part that consider us as users, ratepayers.  It is a disgrace how City of Cape Town operate on everything.  They ask for our feedback about tariffs and their excuse is that other cities already do it.  

Potholes were just "temporarily" repaired but months after it was done no follow up.  I send e mails to CoCT and I promise them if myself or another road user get damage of they not properly fix potholes I will support him her with a claim against CoCT.

I were once a proud Capetonian but this last few years I am disgusted with our once proud Municipality!!!!!}{Last year I fell into a drain (manhole) as the cover had been removed. There was no signage to warn anyone that the cover was actually removed and even after I lodged a claim against the city this hole was not repaired. I was literally black and blue and had a witness and pictures of the injuries I sustained. I immediately went to the pharmacy to obtain some medication for the swelling on my foot and to obtain pain****ers as  I had just been retrenched so decided not to go to the doctor and I assumed that it would heal in a few days.
This unfortunately did not happened as the injury to my foot lingered for weeks despite taking various pain****ers. Eventually I ended up having to seek medical help and this has resulted in me spending thousands and having to forfeit various opportunities to earn an income due to my incapacity.....After the city has been stringing me along for months they came up with an offer that does not even cover my medical expenses...current or future...or loss of income...what a disgrace! I now have to seek legal advice in order to get them to take ownership and actually cover the injury I sustained. To think that law abiding citizens who pay their taxes are treated this way is disgusting to say the least....watch this space as I do not intend on being silenced.  They need to be held accountable!}{I started renovating my cbd apartment beginning June 2018. One of the changes I was hoping to achieve was to upgrade my prepaid electricity meter box which seems outdated old and ugly compared to the complex I was living in 3 blocks away. When I mentioned this to my electrician, he said that he was not allowed to touch it since that is City of Cape Town domain.  I then send email to the City of Cape Town electricity and waited for two weeks without any response at all. Next step was to call them. I was referred to independent contractor who sent me back to the City since I was not on his list of upgrades. After numerous back and forth calls trying to find out what the process is I was referred to the Civic Center. On arrival at the Civic Center and waiting in ques for hours I was given a form with some fields that needed to be filled out by my electrician. Few days later I am back at Civic Center with all fields filled out. Another few hours of wait just to be told that I need permission from the body corporate. Back I went and got the required permission. Another few hours in ques just to be told I need the IDs of body corporate members. At this point I lost all reason at it is impossible to get proper information on the process and a list of all documentation needed. Eventually my form was accepted and I received a reference number. I felt elated and though the process is finally moving along. 2 Weeks later I called the City of Cape Town support center to hear how far along the process is since I urgently need this to happen while contractors for renovation was still on site. I was told that they don't have my reference number online and I need to go back to Civic Center. I already lost days of productive work sitting in ques. I finally  manage to get a quotation document via the City of Cape Town's Facebook help center. All I need to do is to make the R2 112 payment. The Contact person on the quotation form, Eunice Lugalo told me it would be best to pay in cash at the Civic Center itself in order to speed up the process. Reluctantly I did so and made cash payment on 3 July 2018. At last I thought all is done and the contact person inspector Bandi can send his men over to my place to install the new prepaid box. When I called him to make arrangements I was told that my electrician first need to do some adjustments according to point 8 on the form. This could cost another R2000 to R3000. Exasperated but desperate I called my electrician to get a quotation from him. A day later he called me back to inform me that the City of Cape Town does not install any other prepaid boxed other than the ugly outdated one I already have.   I sent photographs of the modern box I have in my current location. It is a mystery how some properties can have slim modern boxes while others have to be stuck with bulky ugly grey boxes, regardless that you willing to pay premium for this luxury. I finally excepted defeat but what about the R2 112 I already paid? It seems like it will be another hellish up and down running to and from the Civic Center to get the money back. I simply do not have the time, energy or will power to go through this process again. Thus the City of Cape Town by their lack of information taken R2 112 from me. I hope it will be noted that this money is not a gift I willfully make but just a symbol of the shear exhaustion of a defunct ineffective system I don't have the time or energy to fight anymore. Well done Cape Town!}{hi there ,my friend paid the account every month ,when the place was transfered to her name she still continued payment up until she  received her own account to show that the rental stock flat is finaly in her name ,for more than 3months weve been contacting head office and she evens went into the local office about the money that she paid on the old account ,she was actualy paying an account that was closed R900 + .nobody seems to know where the money is ,they come up with all sorts of excuses everytime i ph head office ,and i feel like you guys are just refusing to pay back  that money ,is this how you treat your tenants ,shes a single mother and i feel i had to speak out on her behalf ,you guys are very quick when it comes to eviction ,so why cant you be so quick when it comes to money that has been paid in advance to a account that has been closed}{We have been with out electricity for the past 3 weeks.  We have gone to report this at the Department of Electricity in New Crossroad, they dispatched maintenance guys to come and have a look at the problem we were having.  All they did is tell us that the fault on the  prepaid meter box is for another department.  Several trucks have been dispatched to our place and none has been able to fix the fault. 

These are the reference numbers given to us everytime we followed up on the query: 

ref:  ********** 974
ref:  ********** 055
ref:  ********** 743
ref:  ********** 379
Meter number:  ********** 6895

Hoping to hear from the Department as this has caused us a lot of inconvenience.}{Yes, I know what people say: "but it is their job", BUT...
Last night I came home at about 20:30 to find our crescent in Uitzicht in near darkness. My neighbors on either side had electricity, but our house was without power. Obvious knee-jerk reaction ****, we ran out of electricity, checked our box but no, it was dead! Couldn't be load-shedding because my neighbors were fine!
We have a Whats-app group for our street where I saw almost every alternate house was without power. Weird!
 Quick Google and found their help-centre, called (not actually expecting any reply) - had to wait for the usual pres this for this and that for that and pleasant classic music while holding for 5 min when I lady took my call and recorded my problem stating I would receive a fault ref via SMS and they would attend in 45min to a hour.
Before I even received my reference, a gentleman called me and had me explain the problem, stating he would call back shortly, which he did another 5 minutes later with a guesstimated problem of the problem and they would send some-one out.
Forty minutes later they arrived in two vans and got to work. Me and my partner was sitting back and chatting and eventually fell asleep. We woke at two 'o clock this morning. It was FREEZING and it was raining hard, but these guys were still going at it.
We went to bed, and awoke this morning, judging from our microwave oven they completed the job about four this morning.!
Unfortunately I had taken no names for any involved. Gents (and lady) kudos to you!! You had turned what was an unpleasant situation into a belief in our city again. So often things go horribly wrong and everyone is so quick to jump on the bandwagon. I just wanted to say thank you COCT,  Excellent job in miserable conditions.  If you know who worked on this incident in Tuscany Crescent Uitzicht - Please pass them my hearty gratitude.
10/10 for COCT!!!
Charlie}{Hi there,
I am so concerned with he response that I got form the offices when I went to inquire about the bills for my monthly water. Every month I pay about R 3000. 00  ( 3 thousand rand) if its less its not less than R 2500 a month where as my neighbor pays about R 89 a month, we are staying in the same area and we both not home during the day but the bill that I pay it ridiculous. Even after they change my meter system it is still the same - so High as if I am apying for the entire cape town! Can someone please try and find out form the City of Cape Town what exactly is going on with the meters that they gave me because they do not give me the correct answers.

Kind regards,

Pumla}{WATER TARIFFS ARE ****ING US. Im just concerned obout the water tariffs , they are ****ing us this is too much they went up with more than 500% . What do u think  really? I really wonder when are they going to reduce  the tariffs . This is not fair at all can you believe i used  to pay R50 and get 4, 700lt and now im getting 800 litres for R50 where is the other 3,900liters ?  What are they  doing with it . Giving to the people  who are not paying  but busy  wasting  it. Yet see licking taps  running water in locations  and yet they do nothing. 800 litres is not good enough for a family  water is part of nature so why do we have to suffer to have it? . It is raining  nicely  i believe  its  high time  they lower down their tarrifs. When are you going to see what to do . And when are you going to see it done  we had enough  of the empty promises.  CITY COUNCIL .  YRS Supper Shining Star.}{CA ********** 58 - Case with the City of Cape Town

The city fails to see that the mechanics of their chosen processes fails their customers. I contacted the city to say that I have a consumption problem but I'm not sure where it stems from as it doesn't quite add up from a known usage perspective. While I'm investigating I now sit with a huge bill as this occurs during the first period of 6B restrictions. I request (28 March 2018) the city to restrict the meter to a daily limit of 350l per day as this is a sound management practice and will protect all from water losses and penalties.

I eventually find the source of the problem and it turns out that I now have a leak. After fixing it, periodic readings suggest consumption is aligned with usage.

The city doesn't inform me that since talking to me they have decided not to limit my meter until I complete an application form and doesn't inform me that this step in the process is required.

They have no legal concern for the fact that a penalty was issued for the abuse of water which, evidenced by the leak, is like penalizing me for incurring a plumbing fault.

On the eve of the holiest day of any Muslim, being Eid tomorrow, the city cuts water for water arrears outstanding to my property and refuses to turn it back on within 24hrs from full payment of the outstanding amount.

I was paying an instalment each month that would have allowed the settlement of the arrears within 3 to 4 months. Instead of realizing this from the payments I make and seeing the consumption drop dramatically their process dictates that they cut the supply and seek payment terms which is less than what I'm actually paying each month.. Go figure..

The city has failed to see that they are dealing with human beings and not herding cattle. With better processes and interactions with city this could have gone very differently. 

I've decided not to use water from the city any longer as eating and shelter is just as important as water.,,, And just like that the city will loose another paying constituent that affects their strategic business case. So with enough time passing so there will be less jobs at the city too as people are forced to find other means. This is also now a booming industry comprising very resourceful people.

I've also formed the opinion that the city carries the ethos and management approach of the Democratic Alliance. That I imagine, will be an issue for the voting poles next year. Unfortunately, given the length of the period of misdirection and poor leadership the fixes brought by the ANC, when it happens, will first have to hurt before it serves and will hit the public servant the hardest. 

Why is it that in Pretoria, Johannesburg or Durban I can enter into a civil conversation with anybody in civil service where as in Cape Town you feel like the operator is being coached by the city's attorney?

Fortunately, the alternate means for sustaining life in Cape Town is an industry already on its feet and cater for constituents that are able to afford basic amenities. Thank God for this.}{It has been more than 6 months now with our complex having no running water, and we have written on several accounts to the CoCT and they plainly refuse to assist us. We have written to the office of the Mayor, and no help has come from there either.
We are the only complex around here with no running, and the CoCT merely says we must buy a booster which is very expensive and unfordable for the size of our complex, and many story buildings around us all have running water, and our is a small complex. The only option we have to take this matter up to the Minister's office, and/or Nationally because of the plain refusal by the CoCT to assist.}{I CUT MY FOOT OPEN ON RUSTY EXPOSED METAL ON A PUBLIC WALKWAY ON CLIFTON BEACH (1ST BEACH).

NO WONDER PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE!!}{For the past 2 years we have queried the excessive water bill at the Milnerton municipality which ran up to R4500.00 on average per month. Their response at the municipality was that "we must just pay" How can a normal family consume R4500.00pm of water per month? Eventually we instructed the municipality to take out the meter, which we had to pay for, which is their property???? That was 3months ago, so now the water bill ranges from R750 - R1200 pm, which is more acceptable. THE EMPLOYEE WHICH TOOK OUT THE WATER READING CONFIRMED THAT THE WATER METER IS FAULTY.  They pass us a credit of R11 194.78 for a bill that ran up to R145000.00 for the pass 2 years.  The municipality is a rip off. Why do I have to pay more or less in excess of R3000.00 pm for water which is the result of faulty equipment from the municipality????

This comes after receiving a letter from the COCT saying they couldn't do a meter reading because there's items blocking the meter, which was a blatant lie, I'm still awaiting the manager to call me, I went through an exercise of monitoring the water meter reading before going to sleep and early morning to trace if there is a leak and there was no change over night in the reading, the invoice included 2 months water reading in excess of 37 kj which is impossible!.}{I know that the city has reduced water pressure to curb water usage to households. I understand this and have no problem with it theoretically. However, since January, the water pressure to our house during the day is so low that we in fact have no water coming into our property all day long. When we complained they said that there are a few houses that are experiencing this so what they are doing is for a few hours a day raising the pressure in order to get water into the houses. This would be absolutely fine except the council has chosen to do this only at around 22h30 -00h00 and then lower the pressure again before our household has woken up. Now you tell me how does one justify this ridiculous time to raise water pressure - do you expect me to keep my children awake till 11pm at night, even later, so that they can wash themselves, that I can wash their clothes, wash dishes, flush a toilet that 4 people have used all day long etc. I am so fed up with this as we pay exorbitant rates and I really feel that the council needs to come to the party. If they could at least raise the pressure at a reasonable hour like 19h00/20h00 then we could get on with our lives and continue our best in saving water ect. I dont want to hear about purchasing a pump system as I am not in the position to pay for this and really feel it is the Councils problem and not mine as it is our right to have water to the property. In fact we discovered a leak as suddenly our water bill said we were using on average 500kl a day which is absolutely impossible and the plumbers replaced the piping but could not even test to see if their pipes were fitted correctly as there was no water coming into the property. As a result we had a flooded bathroom the next day as there was a pipe that was not sealed correctly - and all because the plumbers couldnt even test their handiwork due to the non existent pressure coming from the council water meter. Help Please!!!!!!!!}{Went to have my licence renewed. When I approached the female consultant she screamed at me about learner's licence before I told her what I came for. In a civilised tone quite unlike hers I told her I came for licence renewal. She looked at me distastefully and asked how old I am. I replied I 23. More rudely than before, she asked to see my documents and told me 'oh no this won't do'. When I asked her why not she told me that my last licence was done in Johannesburg and I was to 'get my things in order' while she read messages on her cellphone even though my proof of address showed that I currently reside in Somerset West. I asked her if she will be renewing my license or not and she said 'come back tomorrow and I'll help you'. The man who came in after me was in the same situation (this I know because he is my father) was helped without a qualm and had his license renewed. I queued 3 hours for this lack of service and unfair treatment. Just one more time when government displays their fabulous inadequacy through the sycophant miscreants they employ. Fire people who don't want to work and let the unemployed who genuinely seek employment take their place.}{City of Cape town is Pulling new tactics to get people to pay for water.
2 months in a row the "Water Meter Readers" came to take readings and each time they Add 2000kl of water usage to the actual meter reading

No one is that F$%^ing stupid. This def seems like a scam they pulling

Example, Meter reading, Actual, was 916, the 6 being 6000kl used by 5 people in 1 household, Water reader marked it as 918. when you call in to have this corrected, the City says you MUST PAY and they will credit you next month.

Then next month comes, they credit you but They Added a 2000kl AGAIN to the new usage reading so you STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR ANOTHER CREDIT..

On 16.04.2018 I registered online on the City of Cape Town website for E-services (https://eservices.capetown.gov.za/irj/portal/) to activate and process my request for a Motor License Disk renewal. I paid for the new license and received an email to say that my the renewal had been approved and that I will receive the new disk in the post within 8 days.

12 Days past and I did not receive the disk in the post to my home address so I sent an email to  **********  to inform them that I did not receive the disk. I received no reply to this email so 5 days later, on 03.05.2018, I called the Call Centre number  **********  089 to inform them that the Application Status on the website shows that my request is still 'In Process' and that I have not received the disk. The operator informed me that the disk was sent and that if I did not receive it I had to email  a 'Letter' as an attachment to  **********  otherwise their systems would not pic up or notify them that I had send an email. Their systems can only pics up attachments and not emails????!

I then typed a letter in Word and attached it to a new email and sent it again to  **********  The operator also told me that I should call back the following Monday to follow up and make sure that they had received my second request for them to re-post my license disk.

The service is completely inefficient and I am frustrated by the lack of response or follow-through. In the meantime I have to drive my car to work and are doing so without a valid license disk.

Now, my question to the operator was... What should I say to a traffic officer if they stop me and want to fine me for an expired license?  She simply told me.... 'You will have to pay the fine'.

The City of Cape Town are raising Tariffs and they expect people to pay for all kinds of services, yet their systems are inefficient and not monitored by staff  in an Online portal that is suppose to make interaction with the City easier.

Next year, I will be sending them a Cheque like I had done in the past. That way, I always received my license disk in the post a few days later.

Seems the systems the City of Cape Town of use is not digitally up-to-date.}{We have a lot of people in our house they adjusted water figures promptly..good service}{I have had six recurring Aqualoc faults resulting in water isolation from around 9am that normally ends the next day at 4am.

I needed CoCT to investigate the cause and as a minimum replace the electronic components that can cause this fault or completely s**** the device. Today, in April the fault manifested and CoCT call-centre says " sorry sir, we can only raise the request to the depo"

Please understand, that this unpredictable and uncontrolled isolation is a huge disruption and one should never be expected to be accommodating for this type of defect - especially when I have noted the problem is a repeat event in all Service Requests.

Poor attention to service delivery, poor communication tools, poor tracking mechanisms of service requests. CoCT is just k*k}{On the 16th April 2018 at about 16h00 I was informed by private plumbers that the cause of blocked drains on my premise were due to the three nearest sewer manholes being blocked.

I logged separate calls for 'foul odour' and '****roach spraying'.

Account Number:   ********** 92
Account Holder: Mr. A Boois 

I visited the Macassar Municipality office on Tuesday, 13 March 2018 to query the very high account and was assisted by a very incompetent service agent, Husim King Hubba. I would like to lodge a formal complaint against the service agent as mentioned earlier.   

I’m not a person that easily complaint, but this time it is important to formally complaint by the super bad service I received and hope that the matter will be addressed accordingly. I also wants remedial action to be taken against this individual to ensure that other people are not receiving the same level of service from him in future. 

I did an enquiry about the municipality account that was R 1000.00 more than normal and wants to query if the account is correct and if necessary corrections must be made. I was greeted by a very worked up client service agent who ask me “   “I don’t know why you people come to me with these enquiries …There is nothing I can do about this bill ….. You just have to pay the bill for the water being used ….. .. You must stop using such a lot of water knowing that there is a water crisis … There is nothing I can do about this “ . I was livid, disappointed, felt belittled and worthless by this encounter.  In my opinion he is not fitted to service face to face client interaction. He was not solution driven, he did not offer further steps to solve my problem or refer me to people who can solve my problem. 

My mom is a SASSA pensioner, it is impossible for her to pay this huge account. Why all of a sudden will our bill be so high? There is no leaks and we always been very low on water consumption …. We are committed consumers who take in any advice to reduce the water consumption even further.  

Hope to hear soon from you.

Kind Regards

Acct:  ********** 60

I have been trying to change my debit order since January 2018 when my bank account had to be closed urgently due to identity theft.

I emailed and the city but response time was very slow from the communications department. I called but the lady that answered sent me an email with no attachment for the debit order amendment.

I then paid R1510.92 on 30 January 2018 which was the balance of my account due on 5/2/2018 so as to ensure that there was a payment.

I am now charged for the returned debit order even though the account was paid before the due date. This was over R200.

I sent another email. I finally got a response on my email on 28 Feb and immediately sent in all my debit order documents to change my bank account on the same day.

I am now informed that a further R235 rand was added to my account as the debit order amendment was only captured on 8/3/2018 even though I sent it on 28 Feb 2018 due to a backlog at correspondence.

I request that the city please credit these two amounts to me as it is really no fault of mine that these debit order runs happened on my old bank account. I really tried paying my account in good time and tried to change my banking details. It is not easy as I am resident in Pretoria and had to do everything over the phone or by email.}{One of our industrial properties didn't get a water reading for a couple of months, after reporting it we waited a 18 months for a new water meter.

I stayed at chalets no 6 ,7.

Firstly, on my arrival (friday 26th jan) when I checked in I reported the 1 broken chair at security , the security then told me that I will need to come back the next day, saturday the 27th January 2018 which was never fixed. The guy that spoke to me( Luiyolo Sokani ) gave me attitude and tried to blame me for it, I explained to him that I spoke to security due to his unavailability, he even spoke to me in a language which I didnt understand which I find very offensive. 

On our departure the lady ( nomathamsanqa ) who checked the place out called him to ask about the 1 broken chair and he started talking Xhosa infront of me which was rude and uncalled for. 

Secondly , I also reported the front lights on both my Chalets that was not working. I explained to him that I needed the front lights to be fixed because it posses a huge safety risk with weak visibility at night.(we had 2 children with us ) He then told me that he need to go somewhere for spares and that it will be out of his way to come fix it. 

I had 2 -2 sleepers which accommodated 4 people, and a plot which accommodated the other 3 people.. We were 7 people in total.
He asked me about it and I showed him that I paid for the plot as well. I had neighbours who booked a 2 sleeper with 9 people in it. I asked him why is he giving me all this attitude when he knew about my neighbours at chalet no.8 that was over booked. I feel unhappy and victimized with  Luiyolo Sokani's attitude. 
Also on our departure I asked him why he didnt write out a report, but as soon as I told him that I am going to report him he behaved in a very bad way .

Unhappy with the services of Monwabisi.}{As a young educated unemployed male South African from the so called Delft location in the Western Cape I pride myself with not letting situational factors dictate the outcome of my future. 
However systems set in place to assist are rigged and counterproductive.
Tax payer’s money is being used to pay so called municipality custodians who intentionally refuse to provide service that has already been paid for.
What sparked this complaint is the fact that every day I wake up and head to the library to read books and apply for work, but even doing just that is an obstacle.
The is a notice board that states open from 10:00 – 17:00 Monday – Friday but employees at the library choose when they want to open and when to close.
I had the luxury of traveling all over South Africa when I was still employed and never did I experience such terrible service such as the service at a Library in Delft Western Cape.
Today they chose to open at 11:00 because they were having a “meeting” not putting into consideration people who have travelled in not so safe places just to get to the library and be productive.
The day I was meant to have a skype interview at 11:00 knowing the Library is meant to open at 10:00 giving me enough time to prepare, Library representatives lead by Mandla chose to open at 11:00, Not at 10:00.
No apology No prior notice, the best explanation is we had a meeting. No tickets given to people who got the first No structured line just a mob of people scattered frustrated on the fact that library is closed.
Something needs to be done about this indifference of service delivery Laziness, Lack of efficiency, Lack of accountability, corruption that *****ed our great country.
We need to stand up and say no to laziness. No to corruption. No to bad service. We are behind as a nation because we have not adopted the basic habits of being productive and doing the right thing. Someone anyone who is in charge of overseeing these structures/ span of controls please get back to me on how this can be sorted out. 
I have a number of people who are very unhappy and need be a petition can circulate and be signed by the community, all for the greater good of our people.}{We are a family of 6 on a family Erf.  We have been saving water since the beginning of the water crisis.  We pay our account timeously and try to save water where we can.  

One evening our water was cut off.  We count not understand why because our neighbours water was on.  We went outside and found an extra meter attached to our existing one.  We queried the meter and according to the Municipality our water usage was to high one month.  We then tried to explain to them that we are 6 people on the Erf, but with no joy.  We got hold of a form we need to complete with ID documents of the people living on the same Erf.  We completed the form and send the form of to the e-mail address provided on the form with all the ID documents.  This we have done numerous times.  

We went so far to take photos of the meter every morning and every evening.  We drafted a Excel spread sheet and on the  sheet is the proof that we use way less than the 200 litre of water.  Still our water gets cut off.  

We have been sending the documents several times but no one reply on the mails.  The 086 numbers doesn't work or you hold the line for 45 minutes just to be cut off.

I do not now how this is possible and it leaves us in a state were livelyhood is being affected. The answer  we have received thus far from cape town city was leaks which i do no agree to for the following reason.
a) a leak is something that gradually builds up from a...z.
b) bills are spread over a period of time why are there no high bills previuosly
c) we never received bills this high which constitutes either a finger or technical problem.
The bill dated the 17/07/2017 were billed for 44.000KL and amount R2622,43. Clearly there must be something wrong as a water consumption cant pick up this quick and drop so fast!!

I have tried to contact them but the phone is never answered. I have taken a photo of the water meter on 05/02/2018 that shows 3576kl.
So now they have overcharged me for water that i need to pay.
Please rectify immediately!!!}{I went to the City of Cape Town depot in kleinvlei eersteriver 3 days back to report a water issue after I check my water meter and confirmed its faulty and no water is being provided to my house, they provided me with a reference number and advised they will send out technicians to assist. Till today no one has bothered to come look at my problem. Reference number- ********** 428}{I am the owner of  Erf. 7412  Somerset West and lodge a complaint on 6 January 2017 regarding unlawful building on my property. After a number if visits to the building inspector at Somerset West municipality, COC ignored me completely. There are also other building violations in our street which COC seems to accept. 

It seems that the political careers are more important than servicing the residents . If the DA cannot upheld municipals laws they should not count on my vote in 2019.}{Vote for the DA or not. It is my opinion Cape Town is going to the Dogs. With all the in Fighting the Mayor and the DA government have dropped the ball. 
This morning I called the Municipality of Cape Town to report a blocked sewerage drain and raw sewerage running into a complex in Blaauwberg road. After nearly 2 hours, I was told that they will lock a complain BUT it will take 48HOURS for them to come and open this blockage. Now clearly this is a health risk and one of the DA’s complain sticks they hit other parties with and yet here we are. Reference  ********** 501

I called the mayor’s office, and spoke to Mr. Roberts. He advised me to call Nobby on  ********** . Then this will be attended to immediately. Well Mr. Roberts if you get Nobby on that phone you are good. After 3 hours of that phone not being answered, I gave up. 

I will now write the Mayer an email and see if there is any response, I doubt it. 
We need to sit and consider all our options, clearly a DA government won’t change anything}{On Sunday the 7th of January 2018 I had a water cut around 5 am. I thought I exceeded my daily limit but I could not believe it since it was early in the morning. But as I could not do anything I just waited until the next day expecting that I will have water back as usual. After two very difficult days without water, I decided to call the municipality and reported the problem. On Wednesday the 10th, they gave me a reference number ( ********** 925) and promised me they will send a team to come help urgently. ever since I have been phoning every day the municipality giving this reference number and the answer I get is always" we are sorry, we are sending a follow up to the technical team and escalating the matter..." I phone at least two time every day and listen to the same sentence from these people. Yesterday, Monday the 15th I phoned again, this time the agent apologised and told me that her previous colleague have never ever sent my request to the technical team and now she will send it. She gave me another reference number ( ********** 879) and promised me to send a technical team within 24hours. Today the 16th, I phoned again they just start telling me the same stories again as for the previous reference number. My worries are that I have spent a lot of money buying water at Pick and Pay for washing, cooking and flashing, but for how long this will continue, why the City opted for these uns****ful people to deal with these analogue meters???  I am dying here without water.....can the munincipality assist me please????????}{I am the chairperson of Rustdal Ratepayers and Residents Association.  I had a young couple who purchased a house in our area in August at my home this morning.  Apparently the council has installed the latest wmd meter on their property 2 days ago.  This was done without their permission.  I viewed their last water account which calculated to R15, which clearly means they use much less than 350 litres per day.
What makes it even worse is that these working people only get water supply after 13h00 in the afternoon.  They are left without water in the morning before getting ready for work.  
This is against our constitution as water is a basic need.}{I first reported this to the municipality on the 21 December as we had just bought this house.  I noticed the manhole in the municpalities part of the  property.  Once I walked on it, and the whole of the manhole cover dipped in. It is obviously way too small for that manhole and falls in.  I was lucky not to fall down into the manhole.  I already have 2 fully replaced knees, and a full pelvis fusion.  If I got injured because of this, I can tell you that I would not have wanted to live through all the associated pain again.
I have grandkids here and because this manhole cover is so small, even their weight tips this cover.
I reported this to the municipality on the 21st December and was assured that this would be sorted out as I explained the danger that even passers by could be badly injured if not ****ed.
 They gave me a reference number and seemed to understand my urgency about the danger of this way too small manhole cover.  
Nothing happened, and by then, we were starting to move in with trucks, workers, cars and all, and if a vehicle had ridden over this, there would be that damage as well.
I reported it again on the 5th and the call centre lady told me she would escalate this issue as I made sure she understood the potential for serious injury.  
Nothing happened.  
I called again the next day, 6th January, and that call centre lady told me they had cancelled the escalation.  Of course, I lost it.  
The purest form of lack of responsibility, lack of duty, dereliction of duty and because of the definite probablity of serious injury was shocking and disgusting.  We pay taxes for this.  And they do not give a thought to the possiblitly of being sued which I fully intent to do.  I even contacted the police, to report deliberate deriliction of duty that could lead to serious injury, but while they were extemely helpful, all they could do was give me the number to call, which I now know by heart.
I am disgusted at the unreliability,  fecklessness, incautiousness, thoughtless, unaccountable and inculcaple action they have chosen to take about this very dangerous arrangment.
I am thoroughly disgusted and very disappointed at their lack of action, in the face of probable danger and injury to someone.
I also asked to speak to the mayor but was told she was not contactable.  I then asked the call centre operator to speak to the boss of the call centre.  I was told that he and all other bosses who could have got something done, had all left work at 15:30!!!!

The lady I spoke to on tne 6th said she would reinstate the escalation and that it would take at least 7 working days to get the correct size onto this manhole.
This still leaves the government open to a lawsuit.
I cannot understand, that knowing the danger , that someone cannot come and put one on like right now.
Its a huge risk, one that will cause major damage to someone's life.
Apparently the goverment has simply shown they do not care.  They forget we pay their salaries and they work for us.}{I don't have water for 5 days I have contacted the city since last week Sunday  spent aboit R200 airtime on the fokken call centrr and still nothing today every day they tell me be patient or they are coming but I am still without water and i have a 2 year old daughter.
I went to the ombudsmans and Patricia de lilles office and still nothing like what the fock is going on.
I am going to the daily voice tomorrow with this I cannot go another day without water this is focken ridiculous.

Ibtisaam}{City of cape town have started deducting earlier in 2017 a fee of 41% of whatever money we use to buy electricity to pay for our water bill which was in arears. We paid the bill up to date on 22 December 2017 at 12:00:27 at brackenfell municipality and they said that the electricity should be back to the same price and be normal again after 48 hours. It is now 6 days later and they are still deducting the 41% from our electricity costs. At this stage it is costing us R50 a day for electricity where under normal circumstances it would have cost us R25 a day so at the end we are being treated unfairly and having an extra R750 a month taken from us which wont be refunded. City of cape town is neglecting their work and responsibility to update their systems and at the end the customer is suffering from it. This morning we bought electricity and the slip said that there is an outstanding balance of R252.97 after we paid the account in full on the 22nd of December 2017. So somewhere someone is not doing their job right

This is absolutely pathetic and extremely poor customer service.}{I've had an arrears amount on my rates account since September 2017 even though I pay my account in full every month. I have send information reflecting date and amount of payment to both the accounts department and mayors office to no avail. Scanned copies and bank print-out sent though that will probably not be dealt with either. What a useless bunch. City only works for some of us.}{WHAT WILL IT COST TO CAPTURE ALL 25 UNDER GROUND FRESH CLEAN SPRING WATER JUST OUT TO THE SEA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}{We are sitting with a gas smell in our house and yard for almost 4months now and we are all getting ill and sick from this and the municipality has come out twice and said it's gasses and they can't do anything about it. I ask anyone out there to please help with this situation otherwise I will be cementing the drains closed and running my own drainage pipes to the streets and on refuge day the municipality can bring spades to shovel all the feces up.}{I have never in my life endured such bad service. We have logged the call of the faulty valve as we do not have any water. This was logged Monday the 11th of December 2017. After endless calls and pleading for help, 267min of actual phone calls, we are still waiting for them to help us. I have never had so many promises and such bad service in my life.. supposedly the turn around time is 48 hours. Absolutely pathetic}{I have been overcharged for water from March (when I move into the property) to September because of estimated rather than real water readings - then went through a whole exercise to have that corrected.  Now (Dec) they again estimate my water usage at 31 kiloliter a month rather than the less than 8kl that I use, resulting in in inflated account of almost R1000.

How can they not use the previous months usage to do a proper estimation.  Extremely frustrating to receive no service when you are paying rates etc. of R3k per month.}{We have been unconstitutionally treated with the utmost disdain and disrespect for having complied with ALL the City's Laws and requirements. Allow me to describe our recent experience.
1. We have done all that is possible to save water short of actually not using water at all.
2. Our account is fully paid up - No arrears are outstanding
3. There are 8 occupants on the property including elderly and school children.
4. October - We received a warning letter wrt Excessive Water consumption.
5. We called in LEAK TECH to check for any leakages - None were found
6. We wrote to Mr Achmat Ebrahim City Manager via e-mail as required in his letter.  We mentioned the number of occupants and detailed All the remedies we had diligently instituted to save water and enclosed the Leak Report
6. We received an automated response advising how to calculate water consumption. No other response was forthcoming
7. No statement was delivered for November 2017.
8. On Thursday 7 December 2017 after we had all retired for the night, council workers installed the new water meter which is outside the gate
9. Friday 8 December 2017 we visited Sout Peninsula Municipality Offices. Spoke to Mr Mazinyo 
10. He gave us a copy of the November Statement and told us that it's the Post Office problem that we did not get the statement. 
11. He also said that the e-mail was not responded to because there was no one to take personal responsibility for it.
12. He gave us a set of documents to complete and submit after having it certified by the SAP.
13. These documents can only be submitted on Monday which is the first working day for Civil Servants (sic)
14. TODAY SATURDAY 9 December 2017 - NO WATER WAS ALLOCATED TO THIS PROPERTY SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING.
15. On our return from the mall we were informed that there was no water. I called the number  ********** 089 and spoke to a Mr Ridwaan who informed me that there was a burst Mains in Morton Road Plumstead and the whole area was affected. He assured me that Mr Daniels was in charge of the work force in Morton Road. By 6 pm there was still no water. I called again after 6pm and chatted with Olivia. She logged that call and gave me a Reference number.
16. I told her about Ridwaans log and she said that the call was logged as URGENT and that council workers will attend to the matter in the course of the day.  She also said that they work until 10pm at night. 
17. I spoke to neighbour and was advised to call the number again and this time I chatted to Peggy Sago who told me that my call was ONLY logged in at 6:45 pm and that there is a 24 to 48 hour turn around time.  When I informed her of Mr Ridwaan she said there is no Ridwaan at that number and the Morton Road matter is still ongoing but not affecting our area.
18. When asked to speak to a Manager of the Call Center she told me Mr Damons can only be contacted on Monday during working hours and there was no emergency number to contact him.
19. It is 09:54 pm and WE ARE STILL WITHOUT WATER.}{Die Stad Kaapstad het 'n nuwe water meter by ons ingesit,  maar dit werk nie ons is nou al 5 dae sonder water.  Wonder wanneer ons weer water sal hê.

Niemand kan jou help met die probleem nie julle sê net jy moet maar wag}{Ek het skade opgedoen aan my motor op 18.10.2017. 
Die straat WR Quinan, Somerset Wes is in 'n uiterste swak gehalte.
Ons het al verskeie kere aan Paardevlei gerapporteer oor die straat wat in so 'n swak gehalte is.
Die dag het dit bitter baie gereen die straat was toe onder modder water.  Die vragmotors ry in die middel van die straat voel 'n dui vir die voertuig wat aankom.  Op daardie stdium het ek stadiger gery en het 'n groot "pothole" getref.  
Ek het dadelik vir Paardevlei die maintenance mense laat weet en daar was aan my gesê dat ek dadelik my motor Tiger Wheel en Tire toe moet neem.  (so hul erken skuld wat hul was bereid om dit te betaal) So gedoen en daar was toe groter skade as wat ons verwag het.  Die ergste van als is, is dat my motor so ± 2 weke voor dit gediens was met 'n Major Service - "Disc pads is ook vervang".  Ekword toe verwys deur Tiger Wheel of Tires om my motor  na 'n werktuigkundige toe te neem en kry 'n kwotasie van R3020.  Die nodige vorms ingevul en alles aan City of Cape Town gestuur aangesien Paardevlei toe nie die skade wou betaal nie.  Ek moes foto's aangeheg het aan die email van waar dit gebeur het ens.  
Daar word toe aan my op 30/11/2017 'n email gestuur waar hul 50% gaan dek omdat ek die "pothole kon sien en dat ek teen die rand van die straat was.
1.  50% van R3020 is nie R1500
2. Die straat was toe onder modder water en ' vragmotor ry in die middel van die straat.
Ek het nie die aanbod aanvaar nie.
Op 4.12.17 Kry ek weer 'n email wat sê hul is bereid om R2416.00  (R604 minder)
Ek het dit weer nie aanvaar nie.

Ek is 'n enkel persoon wat nie 'n groot salaris verdien nie  ... ek moes my vakansie spaar geldjie vat om my motor te herstel. Hoekom moet 'n mens so ingeloop word deur ander mense wat nie hul werk doen nie, net omdat hulle kan???   Ek het 'n gedeelte van my deposito verloor omdat ek nie met verlof kon weggaan nie weens daar nie genoeg fondse was nie.  Jammer dis onaanvaarbaar.  
Tot hede het ek geen  terugvoering ontvang nie.}{I Logged a call with the call centre ( 0 ********** ) , on the 28th Nov , COCTC came out 4 days later after a 2nd service request logged ( the guy said nothing wrong , but yet there was water in the water meter box ??? They were unable to trace address

The situation is critical as we have very low water supply , to no water at times .
I have logged a claim with Insurance and the leak detection people confirmed no leak on the property

The water meter has to be inspected as well as to where the pressure is low from the main supply
FRUSTRATED}{In January 2017 we received a water bill for  R4700, which is 100 times more than our normal bill. This made me query it with accounts department. They told me  the water meter has been removed and that they will get a technician out to come and have a look. In the meantime we continued to get billed on estimates. I kept calling up and same story. I paid my bill every month in accordance with what we normally pay. 

Then we got a final demand letter, which is a low blow for me because I am now liable to pay for something which is not even my responsibility. We then went to make payment arrangement and hoped that the issue will be resolved. Up until today (11 months) we still have no water meter, but City of Cape Town finds it fit to deduct R 1200 from my account every month.

Pathetic service from the people who claims " working hard at making things better for the people".

I want this issue resolved immediately. My husband keeps calling and everytime we get told "nothing sir, call back in 30 days". That is unacceptable.

Regards

Frustrated}{I am still in shock over an item on my City of Cape Town rates bill which is called  Sundry Charge Debit. My normal rates are just over a a thousand bucks but this Sundry Charge Debit is R4560....

Can you please help me with this matter

Regards
Mrs Rhoda}{In jan '17 the 1 1/2 share of my property was sold to a new owner. According to Ghost convey & the attorneys COCT is integrated with the Deeds office and should have changed the relevant account details accordingly at the time. I however continued paying the monthly bill received per their details. 

In Aug '17 I purchased this half share as well in order to become the full owner. Up to Aug COCT had still not updated their systems. When I requested a transfer of the fees I paid to the new account they had closed the new account on the same day they opened it so I subsequently requested a refund instead. In the mean time they incorrectly opened another account in only my partner's name. issued a rates clearance certificate to the value of 3 YEARS of advanced payments resulting in a clearance of R33k instead of only about R5k. Ghost convey unfortunately could not assist as the attorneys are their client but said that it is the attorney's duty to have it corrected - the attorney refused to address the issue with COCT and COCT well...still didn't refund my money but hey - let's then transfer it to this incorrect account quickly so we don't have to fork out the cash that we already received. As a result what should have cost only about R5k ended up in R45k - COCT earning interest on my money on an incorrect rates clearance and point blankly refusing to refund my funds of which I had given them all the relevant proof and completed all the relevant documentation as they had already transferred it to the dummy account created.

Upon contacting them to inquire as to the post transfer refund i was informed that this will take another month at least however I find this absolutely unacceptable as they boast that their system is integrated with the Deeds office and updated daily....

I find the rates clearance system absolutely unacceptable for those in the public who's attorney's refuse to assist them as they cannot bill for providing such a service. Start using your tech in a proper manner and start allowing purchasers and sellers to have access to their information so they can hold the law sector accountable accordingly.

I will also name and shame the poor service received from the relevant legal group as that was another circus to contend with.}{So the new water meter was installed by me last Week Wednesday, without my knowledge (the homeowner). and after just three days it has stopped working. So my household has been without water for five days now, and after numerous phone calls to the council, no one has come out to even look at the fault.  Is this how paying customers are treated. I have never skipped any payments or even paid a municipal bill late. This is extremely frustrating as I have two small kids. Also when calling the customer service number  ********** 089, for the fifth time only to be told that the call out time may take up to 48 hours. It is over 48 hrs  and still nothing, Then the agent on the other end yarns in my ear, how flippin rude is that. I have no faith at all in the Council who treats this issue like it is nothing. How am I supposed to bath, cook, feed my kids, go to the bathroom.... Some people get water for free, but us the paying customers that does everything right and try to save water gets the bad end of the stick. You need to treat some things as urgent. After reading so may complaints about this new water meter, surely you need to sit back and think. ITS NOT WORKING !!!!!!! Do something about it, don't let us suffer from your mistakes. SO PLEASE im asking one more time for my water meter to be seen to so I can get water, my reference is  ********** 833.}{At the end of 2016 TARREN took the time, patiently, correct communication, explained how i can save money, purchase the correct amount of electricity, on the correct date.

We need more such people in the business...}{I am currently teaching in Middle East. My neighbour in SA phones me to say that my yard is flooded. Hopelessly I phone the call centre. I was greeted by a friendly voice on the other side and was promised that things will be raken care of. Thank you Monique. The water leak was repaired the next day! God bless!!♡}{On 31 October I applied for an increase in water quota due to our household being more than 4 people (as suggested by the City of Cape Town). We are a family of 5. Still saving water following all the water saving guidelines. Our usage has been under the required amount I just applied because I was scared that we might not have enough water. So it was a precaution. They replied via email that a site inspection will be done. We did not get a site inspection. But a company called Quetzal Trading came to install an Aqualoc water meter. They said they were from the CCT. This is were our hell started. The first meter was faulty. Since the day it was installed we've been having problems with our water. Low water pressure to peroids of no water. It's been 2 weeks of hardly any water. We are buying water, battling to wash etc. City of Cape Town not being forthcoming and with every phone call all I get is a ref nr and empty promises. Then someone from Quetzal comes. Pretends to do something and leaves, Nothing changes. Yesterday they replaced the Aqualoc. But alas our situation no better. I phoned City of Cape Town again today, used Facebook Messenger (only channel where I get a response saying they will attend.... still waiting. Phoned Quetzal Trading, person on the phone swore at me... So I phoned Aqualoc... They said they will send someone today... let's see... We pay our bills faithfully... save water religiously and this is how the City is not working for us. No one is taking responsibility or fixing the problem.}{I have been trying to do the simple task of changing my e-mail address with the city of Cape Town.   I have done e-mail queries and got replies (more than a week later than my initial query).  They gave me a link to go onto do change the address an upload files, but I had a query and therefore tried to call the call centre number.   I waited 30 minutes hearing only music and voice messages in my ears.  I am still to talk to a consultant to assist.   This is hugely frustrating as something that should take a few seconds is now taking me hours of wasted time.   All I want to do is change my e-mail address!}{I was at Somerset West testing center to apply for the PrDP they gave a form and ask the proof of address,Licence and the ID they didn't tell me that I need to have a ID Photo they only say I must wait at a queue then they recheck my documents and made some copies I waited 1h:05 Min to be assisted as the only have 1 machine for the eye test at 3 they close then they told me that I must have an ID Photo if I don't they won't assist me the I went to the car luckily a was having one but when I get back they said they can help me I must come tomorrow.}{On Wednesday 1.11.2017 while I was at work council came out to our house claiming that we use too much water. New water meter was installed after that our water was cut off. They didn't listen to any explanation although my mom said we are working people and there is no one during the day using water.We cannot do washing or clean and today is  4th November the issue continues. At 6.05 this morning there was water for 5 mintues and then it was off again. Are we now meant to go to work with dirty clothing. If water usage is too high as they claim why not investigate. We are all at work during the day so who is using the water? This is completely unacceptable we are without water for almost a week city was contacted in Thursday 2.11.2017 said they would come out between 24 and 48 hours but nothing. This is wrong in so many ways.}{I made payment middle August to get my license disk, after which they told me that I will receive my disc in 8 to 10 working days. It didn’t come in 8 to 10 working days. I waited about 3 weeks for it and it didn’t come, after which I started mailing  **********  to find out where it was. I mailed multiple times, only got a response about a week later, telling me the disc wasn’t sent because I first had to pay my trailers licence, which I then did. From that point onwards I have been mailing, and phoning City of Cape town to find out when I will be receiving my disc, which never came.

I have tried so many times to tell your teleoperators that I am NOT asking for a reprint, I HAVENT EVEN RECEIVED THE ORIGINAL. The 2nd last person that I spoke to assured me that the disc was posted on the 12th of October. I haven’t received it. I phoned again and then that person told me she could see that a ( and I’m told reprint again ) the reprint hasn’t been done.

I have asked on multiple accusation if there was a place where I can go and pick it up then, seeing as you guys just aren’t getting the posting thing right, but you tell me I have to wait and if it doesn’t come I must just phone again. So I’ve actually asked if I can come pick it up, which I cant, because you don’t have a place where I can pick it up.

I will NOT be paying you another R271.50 for this license disk, firstly, because you haven’t been able to even send me an original, nor a reprint, and because I have been trying to get it out of you for 3 months now. This is absolutely pathetic, pathetic!! If I knew I would have to fight with City of Cape Town for 3 months to get a licence disk then I would have gone the other route of taking a day’s leave and go standing in a queue for a whole day.

Furthermore, I will NOT pay ANY fine given to me for not displaying my license disk, I will go to court and go and fight this, as this is UNJUST. This is not my fault, this is YOUR fault City of Cape Town.}{I live in the Bellville metropolis in a building that houses both private companies (eg Lewis HQ, GP offices etc) and residential. I live in one of the residential units.

All meter boxes in the building was changed around 2013 on instruction by the city of Cape Town (CoCT). After the change I stopped receiving my 50units per month and my rate per KW has skyrocketed. My receipt lists my service provider as Small Power 2. Who is small power 2?

As at the 30 of October 2017, I bought R200 electricity but only got 45KW, how, why? I live in a private residence.

This fraudster wore the correct uniform and produced documentation that indicated he was a meter reader. My friend was totally conned and obligingly informed the fraudster of his ID number and details of his state pension.  Once the fraudster had read the electricity meter and had left the apartment, my friend noticed that his lap top had been stolen and the possibility of further fraud in regards his pension. The gut wrenching part of this story is that while the fraudster was going about his crime my friend who only has partial vision was listening to a CD of bible verses. The CD was playing from a very old computer that doesn't work anymore, however, the only thing that works on the computer is the audio of the CD. My friend is a pensioner and simply cant afford to replace the lap top. Wouldn't it be fantastic if someone that reads this review donates a second hand lap top to my friend.

I then got a new invoice, account summary 13.09.2017, where I was requested to pay 1283.20, which I do not understand as I was told that my R962.51 from my previous account  ********** 42(the house that I sold) was transferred onto my new account which is in question.
I called your call center on several occasions (ref number  ********** 175 and  ********** 170 and now again  ********** 117) where I was told that this will be investigated as the call center can not pick up my account on their system and can not see anything that I am talking about. All they pick up on this account is my electricity account, which I have no idea what they talking about. They then said that I should not pay anything up until this matter is resolved.
I then went to your office in Parow and the lady gave me an invoice that says that I do not have to worry, I only have to pay a R320.78.
Today I got an sms that says that I have to pay an amount of R1511.82 as of the 12.10.2017 and I have to pay this amount before the 6.11.2017.
I am at widts end and feel extremely unhappy because I have no idea who to listen to anymore and what to pay.
At the end of the day, I will be sitting with a massive bill.
I seriously need someone to clear this up as soon as possible as this can not continue.
I really hope to hear from you soon. Please feel free to contact me on  ********** }{I have complaining since 2016 about my rates bill i have logged numerous tickets by the C.C.C and everytime my tickets gets closed without a reason.
Finally a inspector came out and found that the device water meter number and the meter number on my statement is two different numbers which means i was billed incorrectly   and requested that the relevant department needs to update there system (SAP) and adjust my account as it is a "business meter" and i live in a residential area.
I waited a couple of months and nothing happened, i phoned in again and the call centre advised me that issue has been resolved so i asked her what about my credit of the money i payed for 1 and a half year for which i was billed incorrectly and she advise she will send a request to the account department to handled and the next day she phoned me saying that the account department closed the request as the matter is sorted, so i asked her what about my refund or credit but she advised me she will get back to me.
The same day i phoned her back and i got through to different agent i explained her everything and when i ask yet again "what about the credit to my account "and she just keep on avoiding the question.
I am very upset and don`t know what to do anymore as i have tried and done everything they (C.C.C) told me to do.
You can contact me on  **********  if unclear or what to ask more questions.
PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!}{I live in Ward 100 in Gordon's Bay and we have 2 street lights in our street - one which has not worked since I moved in at the end of March 2014 and another which has not been working since 23 September 2017. I reported this on the CCT service request page on 26 September 2017 (ref  ********** 174) and again on 29 September 2017 (ref  ********** 427). I explained that it is pitch dark at night and it poses a security risk for all the residents. I was informed by Donald Pretorius (Senior Superintendent) that the municipality was not responsible for street lights in my street because we have a body corporate. I escalated the matter to Mr Stuart Pringle, who asked Mr Johan Middleton to attend to it. Mr Donald Pretorius was informed by the Ward Counsellor that there is no body corporate and that CCT is in fact responsible for our street lights. It is 10 October today - 2 weeks later and the street light has still not been fixed. Do we have to wait until a crime has been committed in the dark of night before this will be attended to?}{I have logged calls since August for a water leak on the water meter. Two weeks after the initial call I did a follow up and was informed that the matter was resolved even though no one came to the property to investigate. The call was then re-logged and on the 25 August a gentleman was there to investigate but he informed us that he cannot make any assessment as an Inspector needed to come out to the property. It is now October no has been at the property to inspect. The water consumption is excessive because there is a leak. I told them that water is gushing out and the meter cannot even be seen due to it being dispersed in the leaking water. Upon doing follow up I spoke to Rene, Leticia and Nonzuzo at differing times the only one of which who spoke to me with any form of respect and tact was Rene. Nonzuzo informed me that the update received on the 25 August read that there was no leak. I told her that the very man who was at the property said he needed to send an inspector, how can they now update that there was no leak? When you can physically see , touch and hear the water leaking? The meter readers  did an update on the system in April already  stating that there is a leak at the meter, but since then nothing and no inspector had been to the property. Rene had informed me that if the inspector does not find the leak at the meter or surrounding pipes then I would need to have a professional do a water leak detection and that I would be liable to pay because its on my side of the property, this I completely understand. The problem is no inspector is coming out to check and investigate so that I can act appropriately. How many months must there be erroneous billing of high consumption of water, which we already have so little of? How many more months must I beg the city to assist me? The city who claims to "Work for You" We are faced with tariff increases all in the name of up-keeping of services among the ongoing shortages. To top it all when you call the Call Center they treat you like they doing a volunteering service and doing you a huge favor (with the exception of Rene) She was very helpful. I am humbly and desperately asking an inspector to please check the ongoing leak on my property. PLEASE!!!!!

Today it marks 13 days without water at my house, and just now at 21:48 I called the call centre after i have been promised, the water will be sorted out tonight given ref  ********** 271. The agent C Fortune put down on my ear telling they have other client's to answer I will no have water today. I repeatedly asked him to give me his boses cellphone number He lied telling me they don't have cellphones, I have asked him to give me depo cantact number and address responsible he refused too. I cried out to him I need to bath I need water since the 20th Sept I have reported this matter ref number  ********** 568, I called many times been told the matter has been escalated then ref closed I found out on the 29th Sept without any resolution then got new ref  ********** 440 also was closed and I have emailed Achmat Ebrihim the City Manager whom never responded, copied the mayor which also never responded then email the premier which just read my mail no response too then copied the President of SA also no response. I then go on Facebook and Twitter, which I got promises and hope it will be resolved but no success, I then twitted to Patricia de Lille and Mmusi Maimane as the political leaders of the province also no response. The facebook agent lied to me that I have a meter that is set to 350kL per day which is a lie as nobody was at home so who used the water and they gave me number for accounts and the lady Vuyiledene Gwayi confirmed my meter is not that of liters limit per day that is incorrect information. I asked the agent to give me the ref of escalation she gave me  ********** 120 very friendly and heartfully person. I am at a point where I feel being tortured and undermined by the City of Cape Town, being treated as useless and not a human being been lied back and front everywhere I called and seek for assistance. It is difficult even to flush the bathroom after use, let alone bathing the body and washing clothes. It is so hurting to hear C Fortune negligent and telling me I will not have water, he has other clients to answer on the phone, I felt like I am an anaimal that can not talk and been disrespected after I have been so patient. All my calls I make to the City of Cape Town cost me, i have been begging people for water as if I don't pay water of which my account is up to date.

Yours angry and hurt client}{I was called yesterday by my nanny saying that western Cape municipal is here to change the meter. I have no water since yesterday and this is not the 1st time. I called and called and no help. I believe water is a primary need for all human beings. I have kids and a sick mother how must they use a toilet or drink . This is disgusting}{on the 20th of September 2017 some City of Cape Town workers came to my house at No 41 Makana Square Langa in Cape Town. They fixed a water meter and left saying the water will be back in 10 minutes. The water never came back and to day is the 22 of September way over 24 hours. Every time we call we are given a reference number but no one comes to fix the mess they have made.

Their service is very poor. A family of 10 is without water, how are we supposed to cook, use toilets and wash. 

Why must my family suffer because of their carelessness.}{I had a car blocking my driveway. I contacted the City of Cape Town Public Emergency Centre.

Thank you so much City of Cape Town. I really appreciate it.}{Based in Cape Town, myself and thousands of motorists are pushed to their personal limits of patience on a daily basis due to below average civil engineering on every section of Strandfontein Road, a very long road in CT which passes through about 6 different areas (estimate). The disregard for motorists that have to endure uneven roads,  narrow lanes, raised manholes (for WHAT???), and the neglect in providing slipways into established areas (after CLOSING the once "open" entrance/exit) Is a poor reflection on  this so called engineering company Martin and East and on the City of Cape Town for hiring them! Let's not even get into the details of the inconvenience of having the road completed and then removing all the tar and blocking the road off again!!!!!!!!!
Let's not get into the inconvenience of traffic congestion, the rise of SOCIAL ILLS  affecting Pelican Park by linking it to the new development, the closing off of the original Strandfontein road and resultant businesses that were affected by that, the inconvenience of having to make a hundred detours    all around Strandfontein road, the failure to provide an entrance to two of Pelican Park's entrances after callously closing it  (???),  ETC ETC ETC}{I logged an incident at your walk in centre in Plumstead on the 16th of November 2016 for my water meter to be moved as its situated in the next road in front of someone else's house. I was told that they will escalate it to the correct department long story short an inspector came out and said that it should be moved, every time I call the call centre I'm told that they will log it again as it was closed and they can only escalate it to the right department as they are only consultants.

Last resort will be to email the mayor herself..........}{<p>A new Aqualoc water meter was installed at our home in Camps Bay a couple of months ago because the old type meter gave problems. Initially the new Aqualoc meter functioned well. However, when we returned to our Camps Bay home on 5 August 2017, after a fairly long absence, we did not have any water because the new Aqualoc meter did not let any water through. I immediately logged the problem with the City Cape Town Municipality via a service request to their e-mail  address at  **********  When I did not get any response I followed up with 6 phone calls over a period of 2 days - every time I was told that a team will come out - no team came out. I then went to the City Cape Town Civic Centre on 8 August 2017 and reported the problem in person - by that time we had been without water for 4 days. A contractor finally came out a further day later at 22:00 in the evening and fixed the problem within 20 minutes and our water supply was finally restored after 5 days without water. I suggest taht the City Cape Town urgently reviews the effectiveness of their e-mail  service request system and the also the the reliablilty of the new Aqualoc water meters.</p>

<p>This rebate was eventually granted but Lo and behold they reverse the rebate back to R12000.00. All this info is in black and white with emails from the ombudsman.When quering the the reversal they say my water leak didnt happen and the Ombudsman ducks and dives when I come to the office and sends one of her foot soldiers  to explain web of crooked billing system.Theres two other employees that are fully aware of this case which is the water inspector Adli Salie and Ghukkaam Booley who is the accountant in the accounts department.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The City definetly does not work for you!</p>
<p> </p>}{<p>Herewith the order of events as accurately to the letter:</p>
<p>On 15 June 2017 I sent an application for a modified electric supply service, which consisted of two requests, the first was to install a prepaid meter, the second was to recable the property from an overhead existing supply to an undeground supply.</p>
<p>On 22 June 2017 Ann Murtagh sends me a detailed quotation for the service, to install prepaid meter the cost inclusive of vat would be R2819.40 and the cable for the overhead to underground conversion would cost inclusive of Vat R4740.00</p>
<p>I then made the payment and emailed her proof thereof. </p>
<p>On 6 July 2017 Mr Lindsay Johnson confirmed that his team would go out to my property to assess the work to be done. He then advised shortly thereafter that the overhead to underground matter would be delayed indefinitely due to a pending tender process for the city to obtain contractors do perform jobs that require more than 5 meters of cabling and mine required 30 meters. I then proceeded to cancel this part of the request and to continue with the prepaid installation only.  Mr Johnson tried to persuade me not to cancel the underground conversion as I had already paid for my own electrician to install a box and kink pipe on the boundary wall in preparation for it, but I couldn't wait due to personal circumstances. </p>
<p>Finally on 19 July 2017 they proceeded with the prepaid meter installation.</p>
<p>I then was referred back to Ann Murtagh to process my refund, she requested I fill out forms and send paperwork and then delayed even more without contacting me with feedback. I then received an email from a Michael Schmidt outlining their internal processes for refunds and to confirm whether there was in fact any work done relating to the underhead conversion part of my request for a refund.</p>
<p>I then recieved a call from MR Lindsay Johnson Friday 28th July advising that it actually costed the city more to install my prepaid meter and hence indirectly stating I shouldnt expect a refund back.</p>
<p>I find it very misleading and completely unjust that as a rate payer to be quoted for a service, and due to the city not being able to fulfill the service within the initial time frame expected told after the fact that I was in fact under-quoted for their services rendered?! This is an oversight that I as the customer should not be forced to take the responsibility for, and for the City to in fact own up to its own errors when calculating costings for services rendered. I expect my refund to be credited to me rightfully so, and will not stop here to ensure this happens.

How incompetent are these teams that they assume that the problem is fixed? I spoke to Mbaba (who put the phone down in my ear) to Ayob, Monique, Mongisi and finally Peggy.

I have lost faith in the city of cape town municipality. </p>}{<p>Good day,<br />I reside in the Rugby, Milnerton area. I sincerely hope you can assist me with my ongoing issue with the City of Cape Town municipality. It started around December 2016 when I received an enormous bill for electricity (over R7000). As it was an estimation I took this up with the municipality who advised that they would reverse the amount after I gave them the actual reading. Even after the reversal, my outstanding amount was very high. I attempted to take this up with them, without success as they were adamant i owed them the requested amount. I then requested assistance from the City Ombudsman. I received an automated response via email stating that they would respond within 90 days (3 months). During this time, I received inaccurate water readings. I requested that my water meter be replaced as the screen was badly scratched and I could not see how the person taking the reading could make out the numbers. The meter was replaced in March. In April, I followed up with the city Ombudsman, with regards to any update. They advised that they were still investigating. A few weeks later I received an email from the Ombudsman investigating officer, who was assigned to my case, stating that I owed a specific amount. It turned out that for over 3 months they had been investigating the incorrect amount owed. The amount that they were referring to was an amount with which I had an arrangement to pay off and contributed to monthly on top of my municipal bill for the month. Because of all of the issues with estimated readings etc, my arrangement had lapsed as it looked as if I was not keeping up with the payments. They then requested a reconciliation on my account and was told they would revert within the month.<br />Once the reconciliation was done, I was told that without a doubt I owed a little R12000 on the account. I was tired of all the back and forth and the toll this process was taking on my life, my health and my marriage. I then willingly applied to renew my arrangement on the entire amount owed, in May 2017.<br />At the start of June 2017, I received my latest municipal account. The account does not state anything about an arrangement on arrears and I was billed R6700 for water consumption for the month of May and over R700 for sewage. There is also an interest charge of over R1100 at the end of the bill, bringing the bill for the month of May, payable by 30 June 2017 to R9540.86. Total liability of R19590,49. I have taken this up yet again.<br />In this case the City of Cape Town Municipality states that myself and family consumed 69 Kl of water for the period of 26/04 - 18/05. That's 69 000 liters in less than a month. Average of 3000 liters a day.<br />I have been monitoring our water consumption on a daily basis. I have even been taking photos of the water meter to display the reading. My average, when working it out id far less that theirs. Average of +-900 liters a day.<br />I have emailed them but have received no further communication as I believe they realize they are at fault. I have requested a revised statement be sent to me containing the reversal of the grossly incorrect reading. and any other amounts which have been incorrectly applied to my account. <br />No-one, thus far has been taken the decency to assume responsibility. I am just so tired of having to deal and pay for mistakes not caused by myself.<br />Even if this issue were to be resolved, another one is likely to come up due to inconsistencies in the municipality's accounts department.<br />If any further information is required, please do not hesitate to contact me via email, mobile or office line.</p>

So we reported and officials immediately came to check the accident and it took them almost the whole day to fix our meters and few houses were affected. At the end they were not able to switch our electricity on our meters so they had to do it on the pole which was fine, so one of them advise us that we can use it so long and they will be back sometime to fix it. There were no numbers on the meter so we didn't buy electricity for sometime because we were advised to use it in the meantime like that by one of the technician until its fixed, sometime later we went to report the matter and about 2 instances we went to report no one came to fix our meters/box until sometime last year. The problem now is that when we buy electricity at home we have less units and we don't get the free electricity compared to other households, we literally have to buy electricity about 3 times a day which is very costly to us. Can you please advise us who do we need to speak to in order for this matter to resolved and we do understand that we used the electricity free for sometime but not because we wanted to or we made the accident or error but it was out of our control and now we are punished for those actions.</p>}{<p>I ordered melamine board and postform tops at City Boards Mitchells Plain on Wednesday 17 May 2017.

He immediately set up an appointment for us with the local housing office.. </p>
<p>Upon arrival at Lotus River Housing Dept., we met Phumlisa Mokweni who had all the files ready and immediately assisted us in a very professional and friendly manner. She also took the time to explain all the paperwork to my nephew in detail.</p>

I’m told they cannot give me the breakdown of what must be paid and that the landlord needs to call in to get that information and I need to get it from him (Annoyed). Landlord eventually gets it and gives me amounts for Dec, Jan, and Feb - SO I PAY...only to get an email detailing the arrears amount and nicely calculated the difference for me saying what is still in areas...so I inform the landlord as that is most likely his rates portion to pay...he does this the same day (evening)...so now I am expecting to be reconnected again...this doesn’t happen so I email CoCT (I’ve at this point exhausted my contract free minutes and have started paying for out of bundle minutes...shocking long waits in the queue...I feel so valued already)...at 17:30 yesterday I emailed CoCT and got auto reply stating I’ll be contacted in 2 hours,,,never happened...so I spend another night in the dark with no electricity for anything...can’t cook, cant shower...and I have 2 kids with 1 being a 7 month baby boy. But I’m a valued customer...this morning at 09:45 I emailed again...I get auto reply and after 2 hours nothing...do they even know what the meaning of a valued customer is? I then call them, after spending 40minutes on the phone with a consultant,,,only to be told, they will call me back within an hour...that remains to be seen...I also requested for a manager to call me from the CRM (client or customer relations management) department...who knows if that’s going to happen??? So in a nutshell, after paying R5451.24 (as stated on Email from their reconnections department)...I’m told I’m still in arrears and I need o pay another R1900 +/-</p>

<p>Are they being SERIOUS??? I’ve now spent a total of nearly 4 days without electricity after the said arrears was paid on the first day.

I contacted the department at COCT 30/01/2017 via e-mail. After a week they requested certain documents. I sent these on 7th February 2017. The site had a continuous notice which said "in process". When I called at 9h30 on 21 February to enquire, I was informed by Stacey that the ID was not clear and after sending it, I should call in an hour. I immediately sent a clear copy and called after an hour. I could not  get through as it seems the call centre system is very poor. When I finally got through to Melody at around 2pm,  she requested that I call in half hour again as the ID had not yet been received.  She said something to the effect that it takes half an hour to get to whoever and they have 48 hours to attend on it. I immediately sent it yet again. I informed Melody that the situation was ridiculous and that the service was rotten as the site says "in process" whereas nothing was transpiring. This means that if I hadn't called, I would never know that the ID copy was unclear. She said Juanita would escalate and a reference would be sent to me which I could use to pay and the licence disk would then take 10-14 days to reach me by post. Well then, what should I do if in the meantime I received a fine? You would have to query it, said Melody.</p>

Wow ! what are you guys thinking ????</p>}{<p>City of Cape Town Licensing dept refused to renew my vehicle license online, claiming an outstanding fine (about which I knew nothing).

<p>Meanwhile, I contacted the traffic dept concerned and settled the outstanding fine ... still no response! ... and now my 21 day 'grace' period for renewal is running out.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I go to the walk-in offices at the Civic Centre and the cashier (Renee Kay) wants me to pay about R150 extra ... because the registration is now late. She knows nothing about the email correspondence or my attempt to renew online.</p>
<p>So I have to kick up a fuss and call the supervisor (Charl Geledenhys) ... and off he goes to contact the 'correspondence' department ... but they are in a meeting (says Renee); and so I have to wait ... and wait ... and wait. After about 40min of wasting my time, I was about to give up and pay the additional fee ... but then finally Mr Geldenhys returns and they revoke the penalty.</p>
<p>The staff are very defensive and aggrieved to have me complaining at them ... they expect me to 'understand' that I dealt with another department (supervised by Ashley Pieterse), not them ... but what has that got to do with me? It's the council that setup the process they way they have; and not in any way my fault that the one department doesn't know what the other has done.</p>

<p>But worst of all ... I have waste my time and energy to make a fuss, before anyone pays any attention ... and waste 40min because of the licensing dept incompetence.

The result was that I also had to pay a dunning charge which is nonsense.

<p><br />This is now almost 2 years since my query. This is a quote directly from the media release on 26 June 2014 "Homeowners will be credited with the original deposit amount that they paid at the time of applying for the service connection. This will be reflected on their municipal accounts in July or August 2014 and, if the deposit is greater than the account, the remaining credit will roll over until it is exhausted". My account keep on being in arrears and I'm not very happy with this. I pay my municipal account every month and in these tough times money is hard to come by and I have a family to support.

<p><br />About 6 months ago you wrote and said that the deposits will be credited towards my next billing, but it have never been credited and now I'm also being charged a dunning fee. Will you please shed some light onto this topic."</p>}{<p>Aaaah, motor vehicle license renewals - the bane of almost every South African's existence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I renewed two motor vehicle licenses, in the first week of December 2016, using the online portal and have yet to receive my discs via post. To date, I've made two calls to the "customer service" centre and sent three e-mails to request a reprint. I have not received a single response to acknowledge my request has been received and/or is being processed.  Almost two months later and I'm still battling to get what I've paid for. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This type of service is pathetic and unacceptable so I thought I would note it here for future reference and as a little bit of encouragement to the city to get their act together. Shame on you CoCT, shame on you!</p>}{<p>5 January 2017 - we contacted the City to advise them of a leak at a WDM Meter (Blue lid)(reference number  ********** 987), we were informed that a service provider will be attending at the property that same day or the next day to attend to the problem. We waited for two days, until we phoned again, and we were reassured that someone will come out that same day, to no avail.</p>
<p>We have been following up constantly with the City ever since. We have been given the number of the service provider ( **********  with reference number  ********** 336) who attends to the leaks in the area, we have been calling this number to no avail as no one answers the telephone on the numerous occasions we called.</p>
<p>31 January 2017 - I have just phoned the City again to enquire as to when this leak will be resolved and again I've been told that the matter has been escalated to the managers and someone will come out on even date or the next day and so it goes on and on, but nothing gets done. We are sitting with an account triple the amount we normally pay, water just running away and nothing gets done.</p>}{<p>On 29-Dec-16 I requested a ref number to pay my car lience "A renewal advice will be sent to you within two working days". Early in Jan I was asked to send LOTS of info which I did on 7th. Nothing. On 18-Jan I called the support desk: "We will escalate. Ref number should be sent within four working days". On 25-Jan I called again: "Will be sent today or tomorrow". On 27-Jan I called again: "Two working days". My licence expires at the end of Jan but I can't pay all because a simple ref number can't be e-mailed to me.</p>}{<p>I requested a prepaid meter in August 2015. The city has still not come back to me with the neccessary information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, I have turned off the electricity since June of 2016, but I am still being billed for usage of it - I assume based on estimates or otherwise incorrect readings by the person doing the readings.</p>}{<p>I arrived at South Peninsula Municipality at 13:30. Ahead of me were 27 people. I have to renew my vehicle license. Here are only two (2) counters open for this service. It is now 46 minutes later and I have moved 5 positions. Surely SPM could open at least one extra counter! Feeling frustrated</p>}{<p>I have written to the CT Municipality before on this issue, but they keep denying that the system of reading our water meters is corrupt.  Each month they change the number of days for metering - anything from 28 days to 35 days. We are charged by the units of water that we use monthly. The more kilo litres the higher the charge.  This past month I was billed for 22 kilo litres for 35 days.</p>

<p> </p>}{<p>Good day, I am a Park lands North resident for over 2 years now. I have never been issued a waste bin. Upon contacting the municipality I was told that a bin was issued to me which I have never received. However the bin really isn't my concern, over the past 3 months I am finding that my rubbish is sometimes being ignored on the side of the road and so it accumulates. Upon calling the municipality I was told that black bags are no longer acceptable but I can assure you that every single resident is using black bags in the area (proof can be provided) and they are all being collected. I am a rates payer for multiple properties, I cannot understand why my waste is picked up intermittently. It is hugely embarrassing to find that my rubbish is still lying outside my house on a weekend. Please let me know who is the next level of escalation should you be unable to assist.

<p>(2) the consultant was not equipped to answer my questions and had  to check my protests with the team leader each time.</p>
<p>(3) the consultant refused to accept my request that I speak to someone else/his team leader about my not being able to grasp his explanation of this process.</p>

I phoned again and was told that they will log it as URGENT and it will be solved within 24 hrs. Tuesday 8 Nov I phoned again and again I was told that it will be logged as URGENT and a plumber will be there before 15h00. Still nothing happened and I phoned again at 18h00 and was told that a plumber will be there before 21h00.  Still no service. Wednesday 9 Nov I phoned twice and was told that they have now allocated the job to a certain plumber and the leak will be fixed within the next hour or two. Still  nothing happened. It is now 8 days since I reported the leak and still City of Cape Town Municipality failed to fix it. This is beyond bad service!!! In a time when we suffer a water shortage, this is unacceptable.

I spoke to Mr Taki Amira (Counsellor in area) who assisted me in contacting the City Manager. I called The City Manager's office and eventually spoke to Rushda Cummings in the finance dept. She requested that I sent her an email describing what happened, which I did on 20/07/2016. She forwarded it to the Claim dept. who registered the claim. I brought to their attention how urgent this matter is but their processes prevail. On 29/07/2016 i get an email from Brendan Hector (Transport) to meet him at the place of the incident which I did. He told me his report will be finish the same day and he will then submit it to Claims (Ryan). On 02/08/2016, I called Brendan to asked if report was submitted, which he said he did not but will that day. I again called Ryan on 11/08/2016 and he confirmed that the report has not been delivered to him. I then called Brendan and he said that he has already sent the report. On 11/08/2016 I spoke to Brendan's manager Jabulele who said she will find out what happened. She called me back this morning to say that the report was sent off to the District Office last week already.  For all this time, I have been inconvenienced. I am literally driving my car in faith yet put my family's lives at risk as we do not have another mode of transport. It seems like processes is all that is followed and not the urgency of people whose lives are effected by incidents. And then on top of it all, Ryan's manager (Surita Odendaal) tells me if I want my car sorted asap, I need to do it via my insurance. Easy to pass the buck and shift the responsibility then rather taking ownership of what happened and assess the urgency of the matter. I need to drive down to PE on friday morning 19/08/2016 for my 8yr old daughter Gymnastic Championship...so what now ??? Must I hire a car, I accrude more expenses, etc. ???

I got your health inspector Grant McKenzie’s detail as well and spoke to a gentleman by the name of Peter on the 27 June 2016. To date no-one has come out to assess or sort out the problem as we in total found four rats on our property.</p>

Our neighbours property is being leased to six families and the exterminators have traced the rat nest to their property. We have called the home owners, but till now no-one has cleaned up. My property is clean, but my family must be exposed to this way of life, where we cannot even open our windows on advi*****t from the exterminators. We have paving all around our yard, no old cars or dirt piling up anywhere. If City of Cape Town one day comes to address these issues they can check to see how our property looks.

They told me its fine I could tow the car and take it to the panel shop to be stripped and get an accurate quotation.  I informed them that I could do this but this would involve costs as the car couldn’t be assessed at home where it was stationed at the time. They said its fine I can pay for all those costs and they would refund me when settling the claim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I then paid all these cost with comfort that my money would be refunded. I managed to get a final quotation and sent it to them and they appointed an assessor to go check the car which was at the panel Shop.

<p>I am writing to lay a complaint for the lack of Transparency, Urgency, Sincerity & Consideration of the service staff at the Wynberg Electrical Offices. I have been struggling for the past 3 weeks to have 3 new Electrical feeds into subdivided property in Newlands.</p>
<p>My 1st frustration was dealing with the customer liaison offices who were clueless & not clear on processes to be followed. They eventually issued me with 2 Downpayment requests for new connections (R7'600+ each) which I settled immediately.</p>
<p>My 2nd frustration was dealing with the Planning staff on the 2nd floor where they gave me the following story:<br />1) the customer liaison officers should not have requested the payments of (R7'600+ ea x 2) as a development contribution (DC) is required.</p>
<p>2) in a face to face discussion with Mujahid ****son at his offices, he confirmed the amount for the DC but said he was unable to give me an invoice - another day goes by...</p>
<p>3) the following day I return to Mujahid's office and deal with Xavier Rosenburg who was a bit more helpful. He said the following to me "you have to be nice to the people in the office as you need them to help you" (so it's okay for customers to get chased from pillar to post, & they need to accept and listen to CoCT service staff?)</p>
<p>4) The following day, Susan Nel (Planning Manager) gives me a document containing the amounts for the DC to be paid (R11'200 per ERF) along with an invoice for the connection to original ERF (R7600+) - I immediately complied and paid at the Plumstead cash office. Susan Nel informed me about an old meter box which was removed during the demolition & I explained with pictures why I am unable to confirm where/ what happened to the meter box. She however confirmed that the council will come to site the next day to run cables and provide electrical connections for all 3 units as everything was cleared.</p>
<p>5) The following day council arrives with 3 trucks, ready to install cables. They chop up the road, install cables, install 1 meter box & hands me the meter number. They then received an instruction from Mervyn Julie to stop the installation and connection due to me not being able to produce the old meter (property demolished during Nov 2015 by external demolition company). I spoke to Mervyn and explained the entire background to him but he would not listen & was adamant that the installation had to stop.</p>
<p>That was the final straw - after being sent from pillar to post & false promises, I cannot handle the lack of professionalism, commitment, integrity & service delivery provided by the city of Cape Town Electrical Department.</p>
<p>I am suffering delays and financial losses as a result of the councils inability to provide a transparent process to its customers & Franky just wasting our time.</p>
<p>After escalating to Mayco members of the City, I went to the Wynberg electrical offices and in my presence at Mervyn Julie's office the instruction was given to him to follow through and connect the electrical supply. As tomorrow is a public holiday, this compounds my issues and in addition to that, council resources needs to come out to my location again with a team of 3 trucks and 10 people to complete a job that was done 80% already. What a waste of rate payers money due to an egotistical Mervyn Julie.</p>
<p>I would like someone senior to investigate this and find a remedy as I am sure there are other customers feeling the same frustrations.</p>

<p>Annoyed enough to take this to social media.</p>
<p>With the provincial elections coming up I doubt i will vote for the DA due to the lack of Law Enforcement doing their jobs!!!</p>

<p>We have made ample contact with the Law Enforcement with regards to vagrants sleeping directly outside pur apartment in Plumstead but yet two years later the vagrants have made themselves more comfortable. They are extremely hostile and make us feel unsafe as TAX PAYERS (who actually pay to live here)</p>

On 5 May 2016, after getting no notification, I requested an update. I go informed by Venessa Susan Kruger (***********) that my address is inconsistent and requested to "update your records before we can allocate a payment advice". I submitted the required documents 06 May 2016. I received no response and re-submitted on 12 May 2016. No response. On 30 May 2016 my wife physically changed my address at the Durbanville municipality. I sent mail to *********** again with no response whatever. It is 06 June 2016, 39 days after requesting the renewal for the first time. I will have to take leave to physically go and pay for my vehicle license as it seems like the City of Cape Town Municipality is incapable of running this online service.</p>}{<p>Hi. I complained about an plot of land near my flat that needed upkeep. I was told it was private land so the city couldn't do anything. I called the city on the 27th of May to complain against the private owner, turns out it's city land. I was promised that I would get an sms with  my reference number didn't happen. Also I was told they would come investigate looks like it hasn't happened. I called again on the 30th and was told I had to wait 30 days. What the... look it's filthy, I saw rats, some homeless people just moved in. This is actually just such bad service by the city. </p>}{<p>The COCT are currently upgrading electricity meters in my area. An inspector  arrived with no ID to prove who he was.

Disgusting.</p>}{<p>I feel guilty for being surprised, but I had fantastic service from about 10 different people at CoCT last week.</p>

Two other daughters sleep in a bed my boyfriend had to made half to fit in the small space.

Then i called again asking for the invoice for payment and was told they dont know when it would be sent theres a backlog. I eventually called again two days later and was told that my email was sent to the wrong person jackyv after my email was on the registration document following which Delphine Borman sent me an email declining my application on the 11th April saying i should have chosen the option on behalf of someone and they closed my application.

Yeah right.<br> <br> With the crime rate escalating in our area, and feeling forced to use our own electricity by leaving outside lights on all night, because it is SO DARK, this is not acceptable.  There's no shame from the city when they increase our electricity tariff-which we pay, no problem in pushing up our property rates-which we pay, no apology when we cant get our car licences on time-which we pay etc etc etc ad nauseam - but when they are called on to fix something they caused when they worked in the village 07.04 - no go.  Well there is no excuse and their professionalism is disgraceful. We have called every day, sometimes twice a day and been told one story after another.<br> Is the city going to reimburse us for the electricity we have been forced to use over and above our normal usage for the 6th night now?

Its the start of autum and the rainy season and we will once again have floaded roads due to the serious mess these trees create. Secondly the streets are never swept.

My wife has made contact with the city of capetown on severatl occassions for longer than year to get the tree trimmed and we have been given the run around. She was also told that she has to request for the streets to be swept, which is the biggest load of crap as we are not requested to pay our rates as its a must for us to do so in order to receive these services.

We had to pay a reconnection fee because of them physically disconnecting the line. But because they only accept the fee cash, you have to go to the council office during office hours. So we were without electricity for a 2nd night. The alarm battery ran flat so we had no security. The fridges had defrosted so R2000 of food went off. There was no hot water and no lighting.

I am the only Homeowner that have not received a Municipal Refuse Bin in that Development scheme and when I contact our ward councillors office regarding this they respond by saying that they too have contacted the City of Cape Town and put in a request for the Depot to deliver the Municipal Bins to my home. Now here is where MY DILEMMA COMES IN, THE 'SO-CALLED DEPOT' DELIVERS THE BINS WHEN ONE IS WORKING AND IF ONE IS NOT AT YOUR HOME THEY JUST DONT BOTHER TO CONTACT YOU OR CALL YOU TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY CAN LEAVE IT OR EVEN ASK YOUR NEIGHBOUR.

Its been more then a week now and no one came out to fix it. Sad to think we have water shortage and the council not coming out to fix leak.<br> Ref: **********}{Good day, for the last month my husband and I have been calling and trying to get hold of someone that can have a look at a huge horrible drain on our property. We are in the process of building and we want this thing remove. But we can't even get to the removal stage, because no one is willing to come out and have a look to see what is inside the drain. Therefore, no can direct us in the right direction. We have been going around in circles and this is becoming a joke. The drain is locked therefore someone needs to open it before we can continue the process. Instead of doing something every person we speak to plays a guessing game. Which is not helping at all. The drain is on my property. You will have no right to enter my property once the building is completed. Due to high crime and safety reasons. }{I received my December 2015 bill.

After numerous phone calls and visits to the CT Municipal office we have reached a dead end. What I would like to know is how someone can sell their house (to Us) and still owe the City R3400.  and get clearance and then we sold the house and they the City took this persons water bill off our final settlement payment, we are desperate to get this money back as afterall it was a Mr luff who owed the city the money and even tho they acknowledged this, the still wont refund us.

I thought, because it was the new year - there would be a backlog...but no...the City of Cape Town sent people out on the same day as the call and made sure that the blockage was dealt with. As it turned out, over the day, the blockage had sorted itself out and so they were no longer needed.....but they stopped, lifted the cover and checked anyway, even though it was late in the day.

The process of changing ownership was initiated at the JHB traffic office. I have since relocated to Cape Town and the traffic department system shows my status as a transferor in the Western Cape. The buyer is based in Limpopo and ownership status under his name is pending on the system. In an attempt to finalise the process a registration certificate is needed. We have since lost the certificate. Sadlly the system does not allow any between the two of us to print a duplicate. All three provinces (Gauteng, WC and Limpopo are passing the buck). They each provide different reasons why they cannot print a duplicate. As a result we are unable to licence the vehicle. I hereby appeal to the higher office to intervene and help accordingly.}{My vehicle licence was due end December 2015.  I decided to make use of the online system.  I paid for the licence timeously - end November so that the licencing department would have plenty of time to send my disc to me.  I did not receive the disc. I kept emailing them with absolutely no response from them.  Their site shows that the transaction is complete.  I then called and was on the line waiting for about 5 minutes before I got a call centre person who then told me I need to email them.  I literally have emailed 11 times with no response, then to be told by a call centre person, I must email again!!!!!  I am currently driving around without a licence and the call centre can do nothing.  When I ask to be put through to somebody that can make a decision, I get told that she cannot do that.  So what does a person do????  When it comes to City of Cape Town - do not use their online systems - IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!}{Two clowns arrived at my gate the other day and now I am being charged for an extra bin which is broken and dilapidated, unused.

It is now 7 days later and I still have no licence.  I have also phoned the Municipality's vehicle licensing department just to be told by someone that they are behind in processing the online licenses.

This morning, after having water on Saturday last, they tell me that we have consumed 5900 litres of water in a space of 7 hours!!!!!

So I having been paying this company for nothing every month, because the Municipalities poor service. I have called to complain about the poor service a few times, but nothing has been done to fix it and no one gets back to me about the issue.

Then at the end of December 2015 I receive my bill and my water was R24 000.00 (What the Hell). This is a Actual Reading for 16 months. I worked out that my average water usage for a month is R400.00 so times that by 16 is far less than this R24 000.00. I went to Plumstead and was told they will investigate. They gave me a print out of reasons why the person doing the reading couldn't do the actual reading for 16 months. Reasons being there was waste,building rubble, snakes, meter number changed, meter flooded with water. None of these reason are true. The water meter is on Council property so if all these reason where to be true they should clean it. Don't they have a  system or check on report cards. They better see that this mess get sorted soon.}{A friend had sent in for her vehicle licence via e-billing, and was expecting an e-mail giving her the rest of the process.

On 29/10 she phoned and told me I have to pay another R309.80 for a 20mm WDM water meter.
